<b>NSA - Manageable Network Plan Guide</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 1: </b>Prepare to Document. Set up a way to begin documenting information about your network.

<li><a href="#">A more formal documentation approach may be necessary, to include a central documentation authority, document tracking, and enforcement of documentation consistency.

<li><a href="#">Ease of use. Doing documentation should be quick and painless; otherwise it will never get done. Make sure your documentation approach is easy to use.

<li><a href="#">The two purposes of documentation are to share information and to retain information. Does your documentation approach address these points?

<li><a href="#">Someday you will need to consult your documentation to rollback an unwanted change to a device, or to rebuild a device that had a catastrophic failure. Does your documentation approach support recording information at this level of detail? Do your administrators realize that they need to document to this level of detail, and include not only the what but also the why of changes?

<li><a href="#">From now on, whenever a change is made to your network or to devices on your network, document it. Even if you have no current documentation, just documenting from this point forward will be beneficial.

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 2: </b>Map Your Network. In order to have any sort of control over your network, you first need to know where everything is.

<li><a href="#">Create an accurate map of your current network topology. Be sure this network map is stored in a way that is secure, but yet still allows easy updates as network changes occur. Create an accurate list of all devices on your network. For each device, record host name, role (its purpose on your network), MAC address (and IP address if static), service tag/ serial number, physical location, and operating system or firmware.

<li><a href="#">Make use of tools such as Nmap, arpwatch, and/ or a commercial enterprise network mapping solution to discover your network devices, but do not rely on them to discover ALL your devices. A room-to-room walkthrough of your organization will probably be required so that no devices are overlooked.

<li><a href="#">An additional way to gather this information is to require users to register their devices in order to obtain an IP address on your network.

<li><a href="#">The ideal way to keep track of all the devices on your network is to implement a formal IT inventory (or asset) management process. Such a process can help you keep track of devices all the way from request and procurement to disposal.

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 3: </b>Protect Your Network Architecture. Sound network architecture protects your high-value assets by limiting access to them, provides important functionality consistent with your business model, and ensures business continuity in the event of a disaster.

<li><a href="#">Identify your current network enclaves: which groups of users on your network have access to what types of information.

<li><a href="#">Identify the choke points on your network. A choke point is a location which allows access between different " sections" of your network, such as sections with different trust levels. Ideally, all traffic between these sections should flow over a relatively small number of choke points. Especially be sure to identify the choke points on the "edge," i. e., the points of access into your network.

<li><a href="#">At a minimum, there should be separation between your organization's organization's organization's organization's organization's organization's organization's internal network, the extended enterprise, and the Internet. This is the idea behind, for example, putting all your publicly-accessible assets into DMZs (demilitarized zones).

<li><a href="#">To decrease your attack surface, limit the number of Internet gateways/access points into your network. Ensure that wireless devices on your network cannot be used to bypass firewalls or other boundary defenses by acting as a conduit through which other or unauthorized devices can connect to your network.

<li><a href="#">Eliminate all trust relationships that are not needed. Make trust relationships one-way instead of two-way whenever possible. Limit who is trusted, what privileges they are allowed, and what access to resources they have. 

<li><a href="#">Limit workstation-to-workstation communication to severely restrict attackers' freedom of movement via techniques such as Pass-the-Hash. In general, limiting the number and type of communication flows between systems also aids in the detection of potentially malicious network activity. 

<li><a href="#">Use penetration tests and Red Team exercises to test your damage containment.

<li><a href="#">Data traversing your network or moving between networks is at risk from eavesdropping and malicious redirection. Your data transport mechanisms must protect this data. 

<li><a href="#">Use IPsec to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit/ motion. IPsec can also be used for peer authentication, replay protection, traffic analysis protection, and access control. A more flexible option to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit may be Transport Layer Security (TLS).

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 4: </b>Reach Your Network (Device Accessibility). Hard-to-administer devices on your network will be looked at less often and thus are more likely to have vulnerabilities.

<li><a href="#">Establish a process to properly, easily, and securely access (either remotely or physically) and administer every device on your network (workstations, servers, supporting devices such as printers, infrastructure devices such as routers and firewalls, and mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones.

<li><a href="#">For Windows machines, implement Active Directory. Windows Group Policy is a powerful way to securely configure and administer the machines in a Windows network domain.

<li><a href="#">To administer devices that cannot be accessed on a regular basis, such as laptops and other mobile devices, consider using a network access control solution to update these devices when they are next connected to the network.

<li><a href="#">Do not use protocols that transmit information in the clear (HTTP, Telnet, rsh, FTP, TFTP, etc.) to administer your devices. Instead use encrypted protocols (HTTPS, SSH, SCP, SFTP).

<li><a href="#">A critical device should never be administered from a less critical device, because this makes the security of the critical device dependent on the security of the less critical device. For example, a domain controller should never be administered from an Internet-connected workstation.

<li><a href="#">The way the devices on your network are administered should be standardized. Do all your network administrators use the same tools?

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 5: </b>Control Your Network. Users on your network should be limited to the least privilege that they require to perform their duties.

<li><a href="#">Establish non-privileged user accounts for all users on your network. Regular users should only be allowed to use non-privileged accounts. Administrators should only use their privileged accounts when performing administrative tasks and should use their non-privileged accounts for everything else.

<li><a href="#">Letting users with local admin, root, or other elevated privileges surf the Internet or read e-mail is a VERY serious security risk! Malicious websites and e-mail attachments can make use of those elevated privileges to install malware on the network.

<li><a href="#">Configure each machine to deny all remote attempts to logon as local administrator; the local administrator account should never be used for remote administration.

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 6: </b>Manage Your Network, Part I (Patch Management). Establish a patch management process for all the firmware, operating system and application software on every device on your network (workstations, servers, supporting devices such as printers, infrastructure devices such as routers and firewalls, and mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones).

<li><a href="#">As much as possible, patching should be automatic. Remember that a reboot may be required for a patch to be properly applied. As with any firmware or software, patches and updates should be verified to come from authorized or trusted sources, and tested so that they do not interfere with the proper functioning of your network.

<li><a href="#">For the Windows operating system and Microsoft applications, use Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or an automated commercial solution. Windows workstations should be set to automatically apply patches.

<li><a href="#">Any software (or hardware) that you are using that is End-of-Life (EOL}, and thus no longer able to be patched, should be removed from your network as soon as possible. It is a serious security risk.

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 7: </b>Manage Your Network, Part II (Baseline Management). Establishing and documenting what hardware and software is currently on your network and allowed on your network will enable you to identify licensing requirements, patch requirements, and recognize when unauthorized hardware and software has been introduced to your network.

<li><a href="#">Create a list of all the applications that are approved for use on your network. For each application, specify its name and specific version, the reason it was approved, the network ports and protocols it uses (if applicable), and whether it is approved for general use or only within specified enterprise functions.

<li><a href="#">Implement restrictions so that only those applications that have been approved are allowed to execute on your network. Consider using application whitelisting.

<li><a href="#">When creating your device baselines, be sure to “harden” them by implementing the recommended security guidance for those devices. All software included in the baselines should be fully patched and correctly and securely configured. Remove unneeded components from default installs, disable unnecessary services, and change default (and blank) passwords to prevent their use by malware. Limit the number of cached credentials, implement screen lock timeouts, disable Windows auto-run.

<li><a href="#">On a regular basis, use system integrity checking tools to verify the integrity of the baseline installs on your devices. This is very important to discover any unauthorized changes. If possible, automate these integrity checks. In addition, consider periodically reimaging your devices, to ensure compliance

<li><a href="#">Do the baselines for your devices also include their hardware configurations? Some things to consider in this area might be disabling or removing wireless cards, setting the boot order in the BIOS to hard drive only, and creating BIOS passwords. If available, use tools to calculate the BIOS checksums of your devices and record those values in a safe place. Be sure to update the checksums whenever you “ flash” a BIOS.

<li><a href="#"><B>Milestone 8:</b> Document Your Network. As time permits, your processes and procedures for your network should be documented. This helps keep your network manageable. Be sure to give priority to documenting those things that are most important to keeping your organization doing business.

<li><a href="#">A comprehensive backup strategy for your network is needed to ensure business continuity in the event of unexpected failure or data loss. Your strategy should address what gets backed up, when it gets backed up, where the backup media are stored, and how to restore from backup media.

<li><a href="#">Consider accessing high-risk applications and files (Web browsers, e-mail clients, files downloaded from the Internet, etc.) within a virtual machine (VM). This can help keep malware and malicious mobile code (such as malicious JavaScript, Java applets, Flash animations, and embedded macros) contained.

<li><a href="#">A HIPS provides administrators with great flexibility in securing their networks, but it is expensive, and time-consuming to configure and monitor. Protection roughly equivalent to a basic default HIPS installation can be obtained by using the following four technologies on each host (note that all four are needed): -Host firewall -Buffer overflow protection (such as DEP, mentioned above) -Program execution blocking (such as AppLocker or SRP, mentioned above) -Virus scanner with real time protection ("guard") functionality enabled.

<li><a href="#">The best data protection is to not use or store sensitive data in insecure places, or places not under your control where it will persist for a long time. Is it really necessary to send your sensitive data via e-mail? Or store it on mobile devices? Or save it on a shared drive that someone with no need to know can access?

<li><a href="#">Data loss prevention (DLP) is a comprehensive approach to discover, monitor, and protect data wherever it is stored, used, or transferred over a network. DLP solutions can be either host-based or network-based, and typically use a method of tagging data or discovering data that match defined patterns, so that the data can be tracked and access to it controlled.

<li><a href="#">For basic access control, configure your network switches to only allow certain MAC addresses to connect to their physical ports (port-based authentication, or port security) or implement IEEE 802.1X, where client machines must authenticate at the network layer before gaining access to network resources. Whenever possible, require client machines to authenticate using certificates (which, unlike MAC addresses, generally cannot be spoofed).

<li><a href="#">When generating rule sets for your gateways, proxies, firewalls, or any other type of access control, keep in mind that white-listing (specify trusted and deny everything else) is generally more effective than black-listing (specify untrusted and allow everything else). This is because it is impossible to list everything that is untrusted in your blacklist.

<li><a href="#">For your firewalls, consider whether they should be simple packet-filtering, stateful inspection, or application-proxy firewalls. Besides doing ingress filtering, also do egress filtering: do not allow any traffic to leave from a workstation or server on your network that is not absolutely essential for that machine to fulfill its role. This can help contain attacks, as it will likely prevent any malware from "phoning home". Rate-limiting (throttling) can also be used to protect your network from (and keep it from contributing to) denial of service attacks.

<li><a href="#">Limit the access that remote devices have to your network, place them in quarantine, or subject them to increased monitoring. Remote access clients should never be allowed to connect directly to your internal network; they should connect to a DMZ (demilitarized zone) so they at least have to go through a firewall to get to the internal network. In addition, strong authentication should be enforced for remote access users.

<li><a href="#">Require users accessing your network remotely to use a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) and to only access the network from company-owned machines. Require ALL traffic to go through the VPN; do not allow split-tunnels. All VPN traffic should be inspected (after it is decrypted) before it is allowed to interact with any of your network resources.

<li><a href="#">Without knowing what is happening on your network, you will be unable to detect problems early. By knowing what traffic normally flows through your network (" (" baselining"), you will be able to detect anomalies (unexpected traffic occurring; expected traffic dropping out). Your network security monitoring solution should be configurable and precise enough so that you can quickly adjust it to monitor select traffic more in depth if you suspect a problem or infection. Be sure you have a process in place for what to do when a problem is found.

<li><a href="#">Configure your logging to provide sufficient useful information, but not too much: for example, only record events at warning level and above. Your logs should be reviewed regularly— more often if you suspect a problem or infection. Be sure you review your logs within a short enough time from when they were generated so as to be actually useful.

<li><a href="#">Deploy a centralized logging solution. Consider using syslog, an application like Splunk or a commercial Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.

<li><a href="#">To better control your network and to keep it reliable and stable as it is upgraded and expanded, your organization may want to create a formal configuration and change management process. This process establishes review of changes before they are made, as well as backup of configurations so that any changes that break things can be quickly undone.

<li><a href="#">To verify that everything is working, that your network is in compliance with your security policy, that no unauthorized changes are being made, and that your administrative actions are having the desired effect on your devices and users, you need an audit strategy. You can also use an audit to make sure all the protocols and applications currently running on your network are approved, and gather metrics about your network.
