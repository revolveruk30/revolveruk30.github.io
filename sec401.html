SEC401: Security Essentials: Network, Endpoint, and Cloud, Eric Cole
<P>
<li><a href="#">Network security is a comprehensive, integrated approach in which multiple solutions are tiered together to accomplish a goal. There is no single security solution that will make an organization secure, because any single measure could be bypassed or compromised. When it comes to network security there is no silver bullet. Multiple measures that complement each other must be put in place across a variety of control options. Even if one of the measures failed, the other measures would be able to detect the attack before there was a problem - or catch an attack in action - to minimize the amount of damage caused.</a></li>

<li><a href="#">Network security is a comprehensive, integrated approach in which multiple solutions are tiered together to accomplish a goal. There is no single security solution that will make an organization secure, because any single measure could be bypassed or compromised. When it comes to network security there is no silver bullet. Multiple measures that complement each other must be put in place across a variety of control options. Even if one of the measures failed, the other measures would be able to detect the attack before there was a problem - or catch an attack in action - to minimize the amount of damage caused.

<li><a href="#">There is no single technology that will make you secure. Any single technology can be defeated. Even if we had a silver bullet it would not be a good idea to use it because it would serve as a single point of failure that would give attackers a single point of focus. We want to put security throughout our organization.

<li><a href="#">Defense-in-depth should incorporate both preventive and detective measures. The issue with preventive technologies is that it has to deal with traffic that is bad (say) 80 percent of the time but good 20 percent of the time. Most organizations will not risk blocking 20 percent of legitimate traffic in order to block the bad traffic. We allow preventive technologies to allow such traffic in and then use detective technologies to make a decision on what to do with what comes in. Integrated defense-in-depth: it is not a good idea to have one s security concentrated in one area. Security should be integrated with all of the system s components.



<li><a href="#">Risks, can be expressed by this simple formula: Risk (due to a threat) = Threat x Vulnerability (to that threat) ... If you have a very high threat, but a very low vulnerability to that threat, your resulting risk will be only moderate. If you have a high vulnerability to a threat, but the threat itself is minor, once again you have only a moderate risk factor. If, however, you have a high level of threat potential and your vulnerability to that threat is very high, you have a very high risk factor.



<li><a href="#">Everything we do in security should revolve around risk. Security deals with the probability of loss. Before spending a dollar on security, an organization should evaluate the risks, the priority of such risks, and the cost-effectiveness of solutions. You must know what the offense is capable of and what the defense is and what your own weaknesses are. If you don t know both, you will lose. This is what the risk formula is: threats are what the offense is capable of, and vulnerabilities are your defensive weaknesses.



<li><a href="#">When doing security offense must drive the defense. We should care about fixing only those vulnerabilities that pose a real threat that can cause harm. We focus on the threats that have the highest likelihood and the vulnerabilities that have the greatest impact.



<li><a href="#">We must understand that it is impossible to completely eliminate all risk. Therefore, the job of the security professional is to constantly track, manage and mitigate risk to an organizations critical assets. Security is all about understanding and controlling risk to your critical assets. More specifically we are trying to minimize the risk and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems. When first exploring any new business application or system, it is a good habit to begin by thinking about confidentiality, integrity, and availability- and countermeasures for protecting these, or the lack thereof. Attacks may come against any or all of these.



<li><a href="#">While all three areas of CIA are important to an organization, there is always one area that is more critical than the others. Different organizations will have different priorities in the CIA triad. Confidentiality is usually very important to health-care-oriented organizations; integrity is important to financial institutions; availability is critical to companies that generate revenue online. Understanding what the priorities are for your organization is a tremendous help in prioritizing security plans for your organization, from design to incident response.



<li><a href="#">The risks we are concerned with are the disclosure of critical information, the alteration of intellectual property, and the destruction or denial of access to key information. Security is concerned with both external and internal threats. Why break through a firewall, an intrusion prevention system, and a strong and robust infrastructure when you can get someone on the inside hand you the data? External threats constitute between 40 and 60 percent of threats, and yet many organization s security budget is on focused 80% on external threats. According to some estimates more than half of insider threats are due to errors and omissions or unintentional but careless acts. We should be proactive and seek to reduce the opportunity for mischief.



<li><a href="#">We use threat models to describe a given threat and the harm it could do if the system has a vulnerability. Threats , in an information security sense, are any activities that represent possible danger to your information or operation. Danger can be thought of as anything that would negatively affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your systems or services. Thus, if risk is the potential for loss or harm, threats can be thought of as the agents of risk.



<li><a href="#">There are too many variables to ever protect against all the possible threats to your information. To do so would cost too much money and take too much time and effort. So, you will need to pick and choose against what threats you will protect your systems. Security is as much risk management as anything. You will start by identifying those threats that are most likely to occur or most worrisome to your organization.



<li><a href="#">ln security terms, a vulnerability is a weakness in your systems or processes that could be exploited by a threat. However, simply having a vulnerability by itself is not necessarily a bad thing. It is only when the vulnerability is coupled with a threat that the danger starts to set in.



<li><a href="#">Vulnerabilities are the gateways by which threats are manifested. Without vulnerabilities, threats do not pose a risk to the organization. Of course, vulnerabilities do not have to exist solely in software flaws. Vulnerabilities can be incorrect configurations, poor physical security, poor hiring practices, etc. When we couple vulnerabilities with threats, we introduce risks to an organization. A zero day (0 day) attack is an exploit that is not publicly available and the vendor is usually not aware of the flaw. As you can imagine, these are the most dangerous.



<li><a href="#">Vulnerabiliti ive vulnerability assessment can we accurately calculate our overall risk. Vulnerabilities can be reduced or even prevented, provided, of course, that you know about them. The problem is that many vulnerabilities lay hidden, undiscovered until somebody finds out about them. Unfortunately, the somebody is usually an attacker.



<li><a href="#">There are four basic approaches to defense-in-depth:


<li><a href="#">Uniform protection treats all systems as equally important. No special consideration, or protection, is given to the critical intellectual property of an organization. As a result, this approach can be more vulnerable to malicious insiders, because the systems are not separated or categorized within the network. Of all the approaches to defense-in-depth, this one can be the weakest, unless you have a good uniform protection design. This is also by far the most common approach and usually the starting point for most organizations.



<li><a href="#">In protected enclaves work groups that require additional protection are segmented from the rest of the internal organization. Access to critical segments is highly restricted. Protected enclaves involve segmenting your network. This can be done by implementing many VPNs across a single network, VLAN segmentation of switches, or firewalls to separate out the network. This is a very simple yet effective technique. Reducing the exposure or visibility of a system can greatly reduce the impact malicious code can have.



<li><a href="#">In information-centric defense successive layers of protection are built around the information you want to protect. In order to successfully get your information, an attacker would have to penetrate through your network, your host, your application, and finally your information protection layers. Information centric defense starts with an awareness of the value of information within an organization. Identify the most valuable information and implement controls to prevent non-authorized employees from accessing it. Vector-oriented defense-in-depth involves identifying various vectors by which threats can become manifested and providing security mechanisms to shut down the vector - for example, disabling USB thumb drives and floppy drives. ln an ideal case you would like to remove the vulnerability so the attack has no chance of success.



<li><a href="#">Access control ensures that resources are only granted to those users who are entitled to them. The reality is that no organization has sufficient resources to protect all information with the rigor that the most sensitive information requires. Consequently, organizations often classify their data into differing levels so that appropriate protections can be applied based on the sensitivity of the information and on the potential impact of loss. Generally, the best strategy for classifying data is to use a few clearly delineated categories and train your personnel in distinctive category use. You only need a different category when you have a significant quantity of information that requires significantly different protection.



<li><a href="#">Data classification is a prerequisite for doing access control. Things to consider when doing data classification: (i) don t start by unclassifying all data and then classifying data piecemeal. All data should be classified by default. Data can then be unclassified on an as-needed basis. This approach is better in preventing the leakage of unclassified data. (ii) break your data classification into two parts--existing data and new data to make the process manageable. (iii) don t create too many classification levels. Unnecessary complexity weakens security.






<li><a href="#">Who has the authority to classify data and to change data classifications in your organization? Setting the appropriate classification level for data is ultimately the responsibility of senior management. The IT security professional can assist management in making these decisions by using risk assessment techniques to quantify the value of the data and the impact of threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.



<li><a href="#">In order to protect critical assets, you have to be able to identify, verify, approve, and track who has access to given piece of intellectual property (IP). Identification is the process of claiming to be a certain person. The problem is anyone could claim they are a given entity, so how do you know that they are who they say they are. This is accomplished through authentication. Authentication is proving that you are who you say you are and is done in one of four ways:



<li><a href="#">Something you know - by remembering a piece of information and presenting it, you can prove that you are who you say you are. Something you have - by possessing something you can prove that you are a given entity. Something you are - an alternative way to authenticate is by presenting a unique attribute tied to your physical make-up. This is often called biometrics. Someplace you are - GPS or global positioning systems can also be used to authenticate that you are in a given geographic area.



<li><a href="#">Once you have been properly authenticated, you then have to determine what you are allowed or authorized to do on the system. Authorization should be based on a principle of least privilege, where an entity is only given the minimal access they need to do their job. Once access is granted using the principle of least privilege, you want to make sure individuals are held accountable for their actions and you can trace back what occurred on a system through detailed auditing; this process is called accountability .



<li><a href="#">Access Control Principles:
<P>
Least Privilege : Give someone the least amount of access they need to do their job
<P>
Need to Know : Give user access only when they need it
<P>
Separation of Duties : Break critical tasks across multiple people to limit your points of exposure
<P>
Rotation of Duties : Change jobs on a regular basis to prevent anyone from colluding



<li><a href="#">In assigning access, you should give someone the least amount of access they need to do their job. However, this access should not be given all of the time; the access should only be granted when it is needed to perform a job function. What happens in the case where the minimal access granted is still too great a risk and cannot be taken? In those cases, separation of duties needs to be implemented, where a given task is split between two individuals so no single individual by themselves can make a decision. The more people work together, the more the power of separation of duties erodes away, because people build trust. To minimize the chance of this occurring, rotation of duties needs to be performed. This is where people are rotated out of certain jobs at set intervals so the chance of two people colluding is minimized.



<li><a href="#">Access Control Techniques:



<li><a href="#">Discretionary Access Control (DAC) consists of something the user can manage, such as a username or password. For example, a user might choose to give a document password to someone without notifying the administrator. Windows peer-to-peer networks or standard Linux file permissions are good examples of DAC.



<li><a href="#">Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires matching classification and clearance. Controls are set by the system and cannot be overwritten by the administrator. MAC requires a lot of work to maintain because all data has a classification and all users have a clearance. Users must have the appropriate clearance to access data classified a certain way. Users cannot give their clearance to another person.



<li><a href="#">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns users to roles or groups based on their organizational functions. Groups are assigned authorization to perform functions on certain data.



<li><a href="#">Ruleset-Based Access Control (RSBAC) targets actions based on rules for subjects (entities) operating on objects (data or other resources). RSBAC is implemented in a variety of software programs and operating systems (including Linux).



<li><a href="#">List-Based Access Control associates a list of users and their privileges with each object. Each object has a default set of privileges that applies to unlisted users.



<li><a href="#">Token-Based Access Control associates a list of objects and their privileges (called capabilities) with each user, the opposite of list-based access control.



<li><a href="#">Discretionary Access Control works in dedicated systems where all the data and users are at the same sensitivity level. DAC doesn t work with multi-level secure systems, which require Mandatory Access Control, which limits access to users based on their clearance level. The two main ways of assigning access are based on groups or rules. Firewalls typically use rules for access control. One problem with group-based access is that users can be members of more than one group, which elevates a user s privileges more than the minimum required for them to do their job. An alternative is to use role-based access control, which limits users to being a member of only one role at a time.



<li><a href="#">User accounts, data, and their relationships must be actively maintained, perhaps by an entire team of employees. This process, called access management, consists of four tasks: account administration, maintenance, monitoring, and revocation.



<li><a href="#">Account administration is a set of best management practices. The administrator verifies the individual before providing access - this is the most important step in the process. Maintenance is the process of reviewing account data and spot-checking for inconsistencies or errors. Periodically, account management staff should review and update lists of users and authorizations. For accountability, authentications and authorizations should be monitored . System administrators should log both successful and failed attempts to logon to the system. Logging of the use of systems resources (files, programs, printers, etc.) should be enabled based on Risk Assessment of the value of those resources. Almost as important as account administration is revocation . Account management staff and system administrators should promptly revoke privileges when they are no longer needed, especially for users who have been fired.




<li><a href="#">A sad fact to consider is that a plethora of companies worry about their network or computer systems getting compromised, but very few have spent time preparing for that eventuality. Understanding the basis of incident handling procedures is paramount to the success of maintaining a healthy security posture over time.



<li><a href="#">Incident handling is the action or plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service attacks, malicious code, and other events. The scope of incident handling goes well beyond dealing with just intrusions; it covers the gamut from insider crime to anything that causes a loss of availability, whether intentional or unintentional.



<li><a href="#">One of the best ways to act on an incident and minimize your chance of making a mistake is by having proper procedures that are well documented in place. Being able to rely on solid documentation on what to do when an incident occurs will help in minimizing the chance that a crucial step in the process will be overlooked or forgotten.



<li><a href="#">For the purposes of incident handling, the term incident refers to harm or the significant threat of harm. Because we are dealing specifically with harm or the potential for harm, our task is to limit the damage. In the process, we need to ensure that we choose courses of action that do not cause further harm. The term damage means"impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system or information."



<li><a href="#">The key point to keep in mind when defining an incident versus an event is that all incidents are composed of a series of events, but not all events are considered incidents. For example, an unauthorized logon is considered an incident while an authorized logon is not, yet both are network events.



<li><a href="#">A good way to get an overview of the incident handling process is to compare it to giving first aid. In both cases, time is not your friend. You are under immense pressure, and mistakes can be costly. We strongly recommend that you use pre-established procedures that specify how to act during common attack situations.



<li><a href="#">As part of the incident handling process, pre-designed forms should be used to aid in recording events. These forms provide a convenient way to document each step of the handling process and to ensure that crucial information such as dates, events, people involved and systems affected is not missed or overlooked.



<li><a href="#">The longer it takes you to respond the greater the potential for damage. At the same time mistakes are very costly. It is better to go slow and do it right than to go fast and cause more damage. Ambulance drivers don t drive full speed when crossing red lights.



<li><a href="#">The six steps listed here can help serve as a roadmap or a compass to develop a phased approach to incident handling. Keep in mind that in order for this process to be successful, each step must be followed. The six steps are: 1. Preparation 2. Identification 3. Containment 4. Eradication 5. Recovery 6. Lessons Learned



<li><a href="#">The preparation step is the first and most critical step of the incident handling process. The tasks associated to this step must be performed in advance, before the incident has occurred. Another important item to consider is whether to contain the incident and move into cleanup phases or to observe the attack in an attempt to gather more evidence. Because of the sensitive nature of incident handling, any decisions made could greatly affect your career down the road if you did not get approval or reach consensus with management. The last thing you or your company wants is for senior management to question or doubt the decisions that were made during an incident. Reaction time to an incident is absolutely critical. Every effort should be made to find members of the incident handling team who will be able to respond on short notice.



<li><a href="#">When it comes to identifying an incident, members of the team should stay with their realm of expertise. You would not want a Windows expert digging around a Unix system, and vice versa. Being able to correctly identify an incident could be the difference between cleaning up the problem in a few minutes and causing your organization's network to be down for several hours or even days. Obviously, any system outage could potentially cost your company a lot of money, so it is important to be able to identify an incident correctly the first time and respond accordingly.



<li><a href="#">Anything that interrupts or threatens to interrupt normal operations is an incident. Incidents can be either intentional or unintentional. There are different categories of incidents. Some incidents will only require logging, while others will require the efforts of the entire incident response team. Comprehensive logging of all events is a great aid in incident response. You can always get rid of logs you don t need, but you can t get logs you don t have. Effective incident handling is not an intuitive skill. It requires preparedness as well as the right personality traits (team player, cool under pressure).






<li><a href="#">After you determine that the event is actually an incident, the handler may decide to take the steps needed to build a criminal or civil case. In this situation, witnesses should be identified, and a written statement of what they heard or saw should be taken immediately while the information is still fresh in their minds.



<li><a href="#">The primary responsibility of the incident handler is to make things better while adhering to the basic principles of liability and negligence. Negligence for failure to meet a certain standard of care is generally determined by a court of law. Specifically, negligence is defined as,"the failure to exercise the degree of care expected of a person of ordinary prudence in like circumstances in protecting others from a foreseeable risk of harm in a particular situation."



<li><a href="#">In containing an incident, you must first secure the area. In doing so a forensically sound backup should be made of all infected systems. At some point in the containment process, a decision needs to be made of whether the systems should be pulled off the network or if the entire network should be disconnected from the internet. Also, passwords should be changed as soon as possible to make sure a compromised account couldn't be used for reentry into the system by a remote attacker.



<li><a href="#">Eradication : before the system goes back online, an incident handler must make sure that she fixes the problem or the vulnerability that the attacker used to compromise the system. At first glance, the tendency may be to wipe out the entire operating system and rebuild it from scratch. Although this is certainly an effective way to remove any malevolent code, the opportunity for re-infection via the same channel still exists. It is not enough to simply recover the system and put it back online: The underlying security mechanisms of the affected systems must be altered, fixed, or upgraded to accommodate any new vulnerabilities. After the system is recovered, it is a good idea to run a vulnerability scanner against the affected system to see if the problem is, indeed, fixed and that no new holes were opened up in the process.



<li><a href="#">The key point to consider in the recovery phase is to ensure you are not restoring vulnerable code that has already proven itself to be exploitable by any number of attack methods. For example, if you restore a system from tape backup, then you could be restoring a previous state that contained the vulnerability exploited by the attacker. Vulnerable code, in this context, refers to operating system software that hasn't been patched to the latest levels, source code and/or application software being used on the affected system. Although there is no easy solution, using a file integrity tool such as Tripwire might help in restoring the system to a known good state. Anything that breaks after the recovery is likely to be blamed on the incident handler, so every effort should be made to ensure the system is working as normal before turning it over to the system administrator.



<li><a href="#">Lessons learned : after the system has been restored and is back in operation, a report outlining the entire process should be drafted by the primary incident handler. It is very important to summarize the incident, identifying the most relevant conclusions obtained to aid in avoiding similar incidents in the future. The report should contain areas for improvement, both in the security infrastructure and in the incident-handling process itself.




<li><a href="#">One of the things that makes information warfare so difficult is the high number of unknowns. One of the key tenets of cyber security is know thy system . If you do not know what the threats and/or vulnerabilities are, it is hard to calculate the risk.



<li><a href="#">Three basic tools of information warfare are perception management, malicious code, and predictable response. They can be used separately or together. Two of the three, perception management and predictable response, are core techniques of business competition. In information warfare, the focus shifts to technological implementations of these techniques.



<li><a href="#">The focus for information warfare over the past decade seems to be, at its heart, economic. There really isn't such a thing as a neutral country when it comes to cyberwar. Information warfare operations are as likely to travel through neutral countries as any others before reaching the belligerent target. User awareness training can help with both perception management and predictable response. Standard defense-in-depth approaches can reduce the attack surface for malicious code.



<li><a href="#">The most important concept to internalize as either the attacker or defender is asymmetry: information warfare is not a zero-sum game. Asymmetric warfare is war without rules. In asymmetric warfare a fairly small input can have a very large effect. Offense is dominant because it doesn t play by the rules. In a fair fight defense would have the upper hand.



<li><a href="#">Hackers are the most visible offensive players in terms of the consciousness of the public and press. However, an ICSA yearly report claimed that insider attacks account for 90% of the financial damage that occurs. The important thing to consider is that a remarkable number of organizations do not realize they are being used or stolen from. Whether hackers or insider fraud, the criminal world is fully engaged in the internet and in information operations. Whatever crime your organization is or is not experiencing, you can be certain that due to the intense competition from globalization it is experiencing competitive intelligence gathering.



<li><a href="#">On the defensive side the challenge is to protect the value of our information and hopefully reduce the value of the offense's assets. The most common approach to defense is to establish effective perimeters and seals to maintain and to be able to validate integrity.



<li><a href="#">Defense-in-depth is one of our most important tools as a defender. If we can learn to think like the attackers , to see through their eyes even just a bit, we can be alert to the opportunities to attack us asymmetrically and attempt to place defenses to prevent those. Sometimes we may be able to use tools like honeypots to understand their attacks and motives, and we may be able, on occasion, to release some incorrect information and cause the attackers to make a predictable response.



<li><a href="#">The aggressor's goal is to achieve the greatest impact from the least investment possible ( asymmetrical result ). Fortunately for them, the ongoing expansion of network perimeters and increasing system complexity aids greatly in the impact available from a relatively minor investment. The defender's goal is to increase the required investment to a level where the target is no longer attractive. Although achieving a true zero-sum result is unreasonable to expect, there are tools and techniques that can be used to begin approaching balance. Your task is to understand and use these tools to your best ability.




<li><a href="#">The best way to secure your system is to fix the problem, not the symptom. If we were injured, we wouldn t take pain-killers to continue exercising. This will only end up making the problem worse. In almost every case when somebody gets attacked, it is from multiple vectors. Many attacks involve at least 5 vulnerabilities. In many cases fixing just one vulnerability could have prevented the attack from succeeding. Your focus should not be to uncover every single vulnerability in the system, but on those that have the biggest impact and likelihood of causing damage.



<li><a href="#">Not only is prevention usually the most cost effective way to deploy security resources, but it is probably also the most obvious. Sometimes it is too obvious. Organizations that rely solely on prevention often get taken for a bad ride when an attack eventually manages to get through all their preventative measures. At a minimum, you should have well-defined incident response procedures in place to help you figure out what to do when your defenses are finally breached. And they will be breached eventually; it is just a question of when and to what extent.



<li><a href="#">Timely patching can often prevent the majority of attack vectors from being successfully executed. Patches are often available before or very soon after exploits are announced. In modem-day information security, patching of systems and applications is often considered to be one of the most important tasks for system administrators and security professionals alike.



<li><a href="#">You should disable non-critical services that is, services that are not essential to the system's function. Many operating systems come with unnecessary services installed and enabled out of the box, which can place a system at immediate risk once connected to a network. By carefully selecting options during installation and routinely auditing systems for unnecessary services or applications, you can significantly reduce the risk of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. If you narrow down to a select few the range of services you offer, you can concentrate on configuring those services in as secure a manner as possible, while simultaneously denying an attacker any possibility of using poorly managed secondary services against you.




<li><a href="#">Probably the first thing any security analyst does when he designs a network these days is to plan for a firewall . It is almost impossible to have any kind of good internal security control without first establishing a secure network perimeter. In fact, the principle of security-in-depth practically demands that you be able to control the traffic entering and leaving your network.



<li><a href="#">A firewall is a means to control what is allowed across some point in a network as a mechanism to enforce policy . Firewalls are utilized at a variety of network locations, of which two are: Between the public internet and an organization's private internal network. Between a PC's network interface card (NIC) and the rest of the PC. Firewalls may be implemented as: Dedicated network appliances (there seems to be a distinct trend toward appliances). Hardware or software inserted into a network device such as a router (that is primarily performing other duties). Software running on a general purpose computer.



<li><a href="#">All connections should go through a firewall. An incorrectly configured firewall is almost useless. The firewall ruleset should not be too long. The longer it is the harder it is to understand and maintain. The first thing you should do when assessing a firewall is to check the number of dropped packets. This is the most direct way of knowing whether the firewall is working as intended.



<li><a href="#">Firewalls advantages : They reduce risks by protecting systems from incoming and outgoing attempts to exploit vulnerabilities. Increase privacy by making it harder to gather intelligence about a site. Filter communications based upon content, such as offensive or malicious content coming in or proprietary content flowing out of an organization. Encrypt communications for confidentiality. Provide records concerning both successful and blocked network traffic, which may be critical for incident handling and forensics. Serve as a"noise filter"and conserve bandwidth.



<li><a href="#">Firewalls shortcomings : Attacks at the application layer may sneak through. Dial-up, VPN, extranet connections may bypass firewalls. Organizations may let down their guard in other security areas (passwords, patches, encryption). Management sees firewall as a silver bullet. With the value that firewalls offer, it can be tempting to think that they are cure-ails. They are not. Firewalls are not bulletproof. They do not stop all attacks. ln fact, they can be attacked themselves.



<li><a href="#">Firewalls are designed with something called a default rule : If a packet doesn't match another rule, the default rule drops the packet. This is known as deny all except that which is explicitly allowed. Firewall administrators who override this rule create an allow all except that which is explicitly denied policy. Default deny is more restrictive. Default allow is more permissive. The"default deny"stance helps protect against previously unknown attacks and vulnerabilities.



<li><a href="#">Among firewalls, proxy firewalls generally are the slowest in performance and the most inconvenient to manage; however, proxy firewalls usually provide the best security. Proxy firewalls essentially tear down each packet layerby-layer on one interface and build it back up on the opposite interface. From the perspective of the source, the traffic flows to the destination. But the traffic actually is delivered to a virtual destination just inside the proxy firewall, on the input side, where it is disassembled and examined.




<li><a href="#">An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) will monitor activity that is known or suspected to be malicious in its intent, raising alerts to a human to be analyzed. The person who is responsible for responding to the alerts (incident handler) uses the information generated by the IDS to try to identify the intent of the suspicious activity, and takes some action based upon the analysis. IDSs should be used in conjunction with firewalls, anti-virus software, vulnerability assessment and management and patch management tools to support a defense-in-depth posture.



<li><a href="#">Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) usually consist of software that resides on a host machine and monitors the traffic in and out, as well as the integrity of the host's files. HIDS can be trained to record a system's initial baseline of users, running applications and services, and particular files to monitor, and it can then alert an administrator when any one of these elements changes unexpectedly.



<li><a href="#">A common mistake in the deployment of IDS technology is to spend capital money on the acquisition and deployment of tools without a maintenance and utilization plan . The costs of maintaining and using the IDS far outweigh the costs of acquiring the tools. Further, it takes a well-trained analyst to be able to understand and correctly interpret the alerts generated by an IDS, which adds to the total cost of ownership for the organization.



<li><a href="#">When an IDS sees activity, any kind of activity, they must identify and classify the activity. This classification typically falls into two groups- positive for an event of interest (EOl), or negative for an EOI. An event of interest can be anything the analyst wants to identify with the IDS, including specific hacker tools, particular content or keywords in e-mail or instant messages or even a specific filename being transferred between hosts.



<li><a href="#">The analyst will inevitably have to work with four different classifications of events:



<li><a href="#">True Positive - ln these cases, the IDS worked as intended, and correctly flagged the activity as anomalous behavior that might be malicious. True positives generate alerts for the analyst to process.



<li><a href="#">False Positive - A false positive case is where the IDS generates an alert flagging hostile activity which was benign. False positives generate alerts for the analyst to process, who then must decide how to handle the incident.



<li><a href="#">True Negative - A true negative event is what we want the IDS to see, the cases where data does not indicate any malicious activity, and the data is correct. ln the case of a true negative, the IDS does not generate an alert for the analyst.



<li><a href="#">False Negative - A false negative event is when the IDS identifies data as benign, when in fact it is malicious. A false negative does not generate an alert for the analyst.



<li><a href="#">A false negative is the worst-case scenario, since it does not provide any information to the analyst about attacks against systems. A smart attacker may employ IDS evasion techniques designed specifically to generate false negative events on the system to avoid detection.



<li><a href="#">A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is deployed as a passive sensor at network aggregation points where it collects packets for analysis. Each packet that is collected is processed to identify events of interest, and reported to the analyst. A NIDS device can be a server or an appliance with a hardened operating system that makes it resistant to attack. Being in a position to monitor all the traffic on the network makes the NIDS a valuable target for an attacker looking to capture information on the network. NIDS devices use a few different methods to identify events of interest on the network, including signature analysis, anomaly analysis and application or protocol analysis.



<li><a href="#">Signature analysis is the most common method of identifying events of interest on the network. In its simplest form, a unique characteristic is identified for a particular EOI, and a signature is created to identify that characteristic, raising an alert from the IDS.



<li><a href="#">Anomaly analysis is based on events for specific protocols and applications that are outside the typical operating conditions. The IDS can leverage data from these unusual events to generate events to be analyzed by the intrusion analyst.



<li><a href="#">Protocol analysis works by carefully examining the entirety of protocols and how they operate. Based on the implementation and specifications for protocols, the IDS develops the logic to understand how the protocol operates in its input, processing and output phases. Any use of the protocol that does not function within the definition of how the IDS understands the protocol is identified as anomalous activity which generates an alert.



<li><a href="#">With shallow packet inspection , the IDS processes only a portion of the packet for analysis. This method of analysis extracts and evaluates the contents of a limited number of fields within the packet at predictable offset locations. The advantage of this method of analysis is that it is very fast, it can be performed at near wire-speed with optimized hardware.



<li><a href="#">Deep packet inspection performs a full analysis of the packet, including the evaluation of fixed-length and variablelength fields. Deep packet inspection is traditionally deployed at an application level firewall gateway, where the gateway has a complete understanding of the protocol and has the logic to follow the fields inside the packet. This method of packet inspection is much more difficult than shallow packet inspection, and much slower. Modern IDS systems typically deploy a combination of shallow and deep packet inspection.



<li><a href="#">The best way we've discussed to protect yourself against threat vectors is to regularly audit your perimeter security. This is a fancy way of saying you need to hack your own systems. The cardinal rule of scanning or vulnerability assessment is to be certain to only scan systems that you own or are authorized to scan. Otherwise, you will probably be setting off someone else's intrusion detection systems, which could get you in trouble.



<li><a href="#">You should also be sure to give people plenty of warning before starting your scan. Things can go very wrong when you are scanning. Scans often crash systems, and people will be a lot more forgiving if you warn them ahead of time and make sure it is easy for them to find you.



<li><a href="#">Penetration testing is used to test the security of a network or security itself. The testing can take many forms: the perimeter security of any building, server, or network must be tested regularly, lest attackers do it for you. A penetration test sometimes is completed at the conclusion of a vulnerability scan and is used to determine the validity of any identified vulnerabilities. By actually attempting to exploit vulnerabilities found in the scan, a penetration test helps to eliminate false positives.



<li><a href="#">A honeypot is an information system resource that has no legitimate purpose or reason for someone to connect to it. It serves two main purposes: (i) to draw in attackers to understand how they break into a system. (ii) to better determine what is attack traffic so defense measures can be improved. A honeypot is an advanced technique that is usually deployed after other security measures have been implemented.



<li><a href="#">Organizations that deploy honeypots have to be careful that the honeypots do not increase their liabilities and/or decrease security. The main concern is enticement. lf you encourage an attacker to break into a site, your organization is liable if the attacker uses your site as a relay. A relay occurs when an attacker breaks into a site and uses it as a launch platform to compromise other systems. If an attacker can find a foothold behind your firewall, it is easier for him to compromise other systems. For this reason, deploying weak honeypots on a DMZ is not recommended.



<li><a href="#">Advantages of honeypots : they provide insight into the tactics, motives, and tools of attackers. Reduces challenges of false positives, false negatives, and data collection by determining true attack traffic. Provides additional Defense-in-Depth for organizations.



<li><a href="#">Disadvantages of honeypots : Improper deployment of honeypots can lead to increased risk of attack. Fingerprinted honeypots can be used against an organization. Honeypots only see traffic sent to it, and they do not help identify other compromised systems. They can be a resource burden (not set and forget). They are a legal liability.




<li><a href="#">Intrusion prevention technology will attempt to stop attacks before they are successful. How the IPS detects and stops the attack varies significantly between vendors, though each carries the same moniker of "intrusion prevention". An active IDS will stop an attack in progress, but a true IPS will stop an attack before it even starts. An IDS is deployed passively, while an IPS is traditionally deployed inline.



<li><a href="#">Intrusion prevention systems can be generally classified into two vectors - network-based intrusion prevention called NIPS, and host-based intrusion prevention called HIPS. As their names indicate, NIPS products work at the network-level, analyzing traffic much like a NIDS. HIPS products are installed on individual hosts and stop attacks at the operating system or application level.



<li><a href="#">Organizations using IPS systems are often able to extend the amount of time they have to deploy patches to resolve operating system and application flaws, potentially delaying the deployment of fixes until several patches have accumulated and a window for scheduled maintenance of equipment is available. Still, organizations should rely on defense-in-depth instead of just an intrusion prevention product to secure enterprise resources. IPS systems are not a set-and-forget technology. They require significant maintenance and monitoring to be effective defense tools. IPS is also not an inexpensive tool for enterprise-wide deployment.



<li><a href="#">HIPS software uses a technique called system call interception (which is very similar to what anti-virus vendors have been doing for many years). The HIPS software inserts its own processes between applications accessing resources on the host and the actual OS resources. This way, the HIPS software has the ability to deny or permit those requests based on whether the request is identified as malicious or benign.



<li><a href="#">Advanced Application Shielding is a HIPS feature that essentially locks an application into a sandbox where it is not permitted to communicate with other applications. Many exploits tend to rely on an operating systems' applications to launch attacks. If an application is locked down and prevented from communicating with other applications, you have essentially mitigated a big threat.



<li><a href="#">Most organizations commonly implement NIPS technology at the perimeter in two or more areas. There are benefits to implementing IPS technology in different locations. The advantages of deploying an IPS system in front of the firewall is the overall protection it gives the firewall itself, as well as the DMZ systems. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aimed at your firewall can be mitigated using this method as well. Although NIPS devices are gaining momentum they cannot detect malicious traffic that is encrypted.



<li><a href="#">A false-positive in relationship to a NIPS device means that legitimate traffic is dropped, inflicting a denial-ofservice. Organizations can't afford false-positives with NIPS devices, so vendors make use of a combination of passive OS and vulnerability detection, network architecture identification, hierarchical rule classification and fewer rules than traditional NIDS devices. NIPS devices cannot have as extensive of a rule-base for identifying attacks on the network as an IDS. Where a NIDS can rely on an analyst to decide whether an alert is a true-positive or a false-positive, the NIPS device does not enjoy the same luxury.

<li><a href="#">Although there are probably thousands of different exploits attackers can use against your systems, most can be classed into one or more categories, along with other similar exploits. A lot of research is being done to try to define a standard threat taxonomy, but so far none have been accepted widely.



<li><a href="#">The entry points for attacks have not changed in the last 15 years. Most attacks will use the path of least resistance. Therefore, the tried-and-true methods are still used today and are very effective.



<li><a href="#">In the classic sense of a planned attack, executed by a hacker with malicious intent, a sequence of events typically takes place. First, in the reconnaissance phase, the attacker gently probes the system(s) or network(s) to get a sense of what is out there. Next, after discovering potential targets, the attacker performs more thorough system scanning, if necessary, and the process of enumeration . With enumeration, the attacker attempts to gain some actual information about the network or system's users, specific system names, open shares, SNMP or LDAP directories, and so on. Finally, using any number of methods, the attacker actually attempts to penetrate the system or network and gain access and control of the resource in question.



<li><a href="#">Logic bombs are small programs or sections of a program triggered by some event, such as a certain date or time, a certain percentage of disk space filled, the removal of a fi le, and so on. For example, a programmer could establish a logic bomb to delete critical sections of code if she is terminated from the company.



<li><a href="#">Trojan horses (often just called Trojans) are often disguised as helpful or entertaining programs (such as operating system patches, Linux packages, or games). Once executed, however, Trojans perform actions the user did not intend, such as opening certain ports for later intruder access, replacing certain files with other malicious files, and so on.



<li><a href="#">Trap doors, also referred to as backdoors , are bits of code embedded in programs by the programmer(s) to quickly gain access at a later time, often during the debugging phase. If an unscrupulous programmer purposely leaves this code in or simply forgets to remove it, a potential security hole is introduced. Trap doors can be almost impossible to reliably remove, and often reformatting of the system is the only sure way.



<li><a href="#">Denial of service (DoS) attacks became quite popular in the early 2000' s, but they've probably been around almost as long as computers themselves. As the name implies, a DoS attack occurs when a user is deprived of the use of some data, computing resource, or service due to malicious actions on the part of an attacker.



<li><a href="#">In a Smurf DoS attack , an attacker spoofs the victim's IP address and sends an ICMP ECHO request to the broadcast address of an arbitrary network. When every system on this network responds to the victim, a DoS occurs.



<li><a href="#">In a SYN flood attack a spoofed IP address is used to send a SYN packet to the target. It then responds with a SYN/ACK that never receives the final ACK to complete the three-way handshake. This hanging connection occupies a portion of the target's pre-established buffer for TCP connections. By filling this buffer to capacity with fake SYN packets, an attacker can effectively prevent the target system from accepting legitimate requests.



<li><a href="#">ln a DDoS attack , or a distributed denial of service, an attacker recruits zombie systems ahead of time to simultaneously release a flood of traffic at a specific target.



<li><a href="#">There are many types of malicious data attacks, most of which rely on poor programming practices with careless error checking on input data. An attacker might put an alphabetic string where a numerical value is expected, bringing down a popular database application. Worse yet, he might insert Unix shell commands into input in such a way as to trick the back-end web application into executing them on the server.



<li><a href="#">Buffer overflow attack : programs allocate a certain amount of buffer space (memory) to perform operations. In poorly coded applications, no boundary checks are present to ensure buffers are not 'overfilled'. The 'extra' code placed in the buffer can sometimes be used to execute system commands.



<li><a href="#">Brute force attack : An attempt to gain access to a system by bombarding it with possible guesses until the correct one is found. Their goal is to guess a secret of some sort, like a password or an encryption key. The problem is that they're often nothing more than undirected searches that try every possible combination of inputs until they happen to get lucky. As you can probably imagine, this takes an extremely long time, making it probably the least efficient attack possible.



<li><a href="#">One especially troublesome form of alteration attack is the rootkit . A rootkit is a cracker tool meant to be stealthily inserted into the local OS and subvert it so that it only does what the attacker wants it to do. This can be a devastatingly effective form of attack. Modern rootkits often subvert the kernel: process management, file access, security and memory management functions.



<li><a href="#">There are so many attack methods that you really can't rely on just one or two preventive measures to protect yourself. You've got to follow the entire risk management cycle, from prevention, through detection, all the way to response, and back again to the beginning. You should use several distinct countermeasures and address each phase of the cycle somehow.



<li><a href="#">People often are the weakest links in an organization's security. All the technology in the world cannot protect your network from a user who willingly gives out her password or innocently installs malicious software. Social engineering is the term used to describe an attempt to manipulate or trick a person into providing valuable information or access to that information.



<li><a href="#">The best-known techniques of social engineering are urgency, impersonation, and third-person authorization. Exploiting human curiosity, gullibility, or greed, even automatically via the use of mass-mail worms, is pure social engineering at work. Phishing is a perfect example of how this can be used to cause harm. These examples show how human nature can make it easy for an attacker to walk right in to your network. Why hack through someone's security system when you can get a user to open the door for you?



<li><a href="#">Social engineering defense : Develop appropriate security policies. Establish procedures for granting access and reporting violations. Educate users about vulnerabilities and how to report suspicious activity. Security policies should establish such things as the types of access allowed, the people authorized to grant such access, and the circumstances under which exceptions might be granted. Finally, educate your users about these types of threats. In most cases, users do not maliciously create security problems--they generally do so out of ignorance. If users are aware of the threats, they can properly guard against them.




<li><a href="#">Risk management is much more than just determining the various risks you are exposed to. It is an exploration of the various approaches and techniques for managing these risks. Risk management's main focus is to reduce the risk until it is at an acceptable level. The actual acceptable level will vary from company to company. However, risk management means that we need to identify, control, and minimize the loss associated with each risk.



<li><a href="#">As a general rule, before you can begin managing risks, you need to understand your business operations and the types of risks that they might be exposed to. Why is risk management so important to an organization? The fact is there are risks all around us. Some risks are not that damaging, although some can cause catastrophic results. The question is whether you know what those risks are. More importantly, what will you do if they become real?



<li><a href="#">We structure our definitions and assumptions about risks around the concepts of the information security triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. We should keep these concepts in mind when performing risk assessments and subsequent risk management decisions. ln risk management, we are looking at ways to minimize the impact that could affect the confidentiality of our information, the integrity of our systems and data, and the availability of our infrastructure.



<li><a href="#">The objective of risk management is to identify specific areas where safeguards (or countermeasures) are needed to prevent deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized disclosure or modification of information. The steps for an effective risk management process are:



<li><a href="#">Conduct a rapid assessment of risks so you know what your security policy needs to cover.



<li><a href="#">Fully analyze risks, or identify industry practice for due care; analyze vulnerabilities.



<li><a href="#">Set up a security infrastructure. Design controls; write standards for each technology.



<li><a href="#">Identify available resources, prioritize countermeasures, and implement priority countermeasures.



<li><a href="#">Conduct periodic reviews and possibly tests. Implement intrusion prevention and incident response.



<li><a href="#">After your security policy is defined, the next step is to set up the security infrastructure. This could be a combination of administrative, technical, or physical security controls to address the risks identified. Administrative controls include policies, procedures and end-user security awareness training. Technical controls are technology-based solutions. Firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, anti-virus software protection, and the use of encryption are examples of technical controls.



<li><a href="#">To decide between accepting, mitigating, or transferring the risk, we need to better understand the risk and how it affects us. When evaluating risk, it is helpful to ask yourself some key questions: 1. What could happen? 2. If it happened, how bad could it be? 3. How often could it happen? 4. How reliable are the answers to the previous questions?



<li><a href="#">There are two risk assessment approaches: qualitative and quantitative. In quantitative risk assessment , we try to assign an objective numeric value; typically, this value represents a monetary loss value. Qualitative risk assessment , on the other hand, deals with more intangible values, and focuses on variables and not just the monetary losses. Quantitative risk assessment is a far more valuable business tool, because it works on metrics- usually in dollars. And the bottom line cost in dollars is what management is looking for when trying to understand the implications of how a risk can affect the organization. ln qualitative risk assessment, the results are typically categorized as low, medium, or high-risk events.



<li><a href="#">The process of determining what is at risk and what is the impact if the identified threats materialize is known as risk analysis . The purpose of risk analysis is to: Identify existing countermeasures, threats, and vulnerabilities. Support the expenditure of resources and to determine the most cost-effective safeguards to offset the risks. Aid in the selection of cost-effective countermeasures that will reduce existing risks to an acceptable level.
