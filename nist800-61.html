<b>800-61 - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#">An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Events include a user connecting to a file share, a server receiving a request for a web page, a user sending email, and a firewall blocking a connection attempt. Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and execution of malware that destroys data.

<li><a href="#">A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.

<li><a href="#">Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms used by the incident response team. SOPs should be reasonably comprehensive and detailed to ensure that the priorities of the organization are reflected in response operations. In addition, following standardized responses should minimize errors, particularly those that might be caused by stressful incident handling situations. 

<li><a href="#">The incident handlers analyze the incident data, determine the impact of the incident, and act appropriately to limit the damage and restore normal services. The incident response team’s success depends on the participation and cooperation of individuals throughout the organization. 

<li><a href="#">Keeping the number of incidents reasonably low is very important to protect the business processes of the organization. If security controls are insufficient, higher volumes of incidents may occur, overwhelming the incident response team.

<li><a href="#">Although incident response teams are generally not responsible for securing resources, they can be advocates of sound security practices. An incident response team may be able to identify problems that the organization is otherwise not aware of; the team can play a key role in risk assessment and training by identifying gaps.

<li><a href="#">Incidents can occur in countless ways, so it is infeasible to develop step-by-step instructions for handling every incident. Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on being prepared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors. Different types of incidents merit different response strategies.

<li><a href="#">For many organizations, the most challenging part of the incident response process is accurately detecting and assessing possible incidents— determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the type, extent, and magnitude of the problem.

<li><a href="#">Signs of an incident fall into one of two categories: precursors and indicators. A precursor is a sign that an incident may occur in the future. An indicator is a sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occurring now.

<li><a href="#">Examples of precursors are: 
<br>• Web server log entries that show the usage of a vulnerability scanner 
<br>• An announcement of a new exploit that targets a vulnerability of the organization’s mail server 
<br>• A threat from a group stating that the group will attack the organization.

<li><a href="#">Too many types of indicators exist to exhaustively list them, but some examples are listed below: 
<br>• A network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a buffer overflow attempt occurs against a database server.
<br>• Antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with malware. 
<br>• A system administrator sees a filename with unusual characters.
<br>• A host records an auditing configuration change in its log.
<br>• An application logs multiple failed login attempts from an unfamiliar remote system. 
<br>• An email administrator sees a large number of bounced emails with suspicious content. 
<br>• A network administrator notices an unusual deviation from typical network traffic flows. 

<li><a href="#">Most IDPS products use attack signatures to identify malicious activity; the signatures must be kept up to date so that the newest attacks can be detected. IDPS software often produces false positives— alerts that indicate malicious activity is occurring, when in fact there has been none. Analysts should manually validate IDPS alerts either by closely reviewing the recorded supporting data or by getting related data from other sources.

<li><a href="#">Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products are similar to IDPS products, but they generate alerts based on analysis of log data.

<li><a href="#">Logs from operating systems, services, and applications (particularly audit-related data) are frequently of great value when an incident occurs, such as recording which accounts were accessed and what actions were performed. Organizations should require a baseline level of logging on all systems and a higher baseline level on critical systems.

<li><a href="#">Keeping up with new vulnerabilities and exploits can prevent some incidents from occurring and assist in detecting and analyzing new attacks. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) contains information on vulnerabilities.

<li><a href="#">Even if an indicator is accurate, it does not necessarily mean that an incident has occurred. Some indicators, such as a server crash or modification of critical files, could happen for several reasons other than a security incident, including human error. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is reasonable to suspect that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly.

<li><a href="#">Small signs such as one change in one system configuration file may be the only indicators that an incident has occurred. In incident handling, detection may be the most difficult task. Incident handlers are responsible for analyzing ambiguous, contradictory, and incomplete symptoms to determine what has happened.

<li><a href="#">When the team believes that an incident has occurred, the team should rapidly perform an initial analysis to determine the incident’s scope, such as which networks, systems, or applications are affected; who or what originated the incident; and how the incident is occurring (e.g., what tools or attack methods are being used, what vulnerabilities are being exploited).

<li><a href="#">The following are recommendations for making incident analysis easier and more effective:

<p>• Profile Networks and Systems. Profiling is measuring the characteristics of expected activity so that changes to it can be more easily identified. Examples of profiling are running file integrity checking software on hosts to derive checksums for critical files and monitoring network bandwidth usage to determine what the average and peak usage levels are on various days and times.

<p>• Understand Normal Behaviors. Incident response team members should study networks, systems, and applications to understand what their normal behavior is so that abnormal behavior can be recognized more easily. One way to gain this knowledge is through reviewing log entries and security alerts. As handlers become more familiar with the logs and alerts, they should be able to focus on unexplained entries, which are usually more important to investigate. Conducting frequent log reviews should keep the knowledge fresh, and the analyst should be able to notice trends and changes over time.

<p>• Creating and implementing a log retention policy that specifies how long log data should be maintained may be extremely helpful in analysis because older log entries may show reconnaissance activity or previous instances of similar attacks.

<p>• Perform Event Correlation. Evidence of an incident may be captured in several logs that each contain different types of data— a firewall log may have the source IP address that was used, whereas an application log may contain a username. Correlating events among multiple indicator sources can be invaluable in validating whether a particular incident occurred.

<p>• Maintain and Use a Knowledge Base of Information. The knowledge base should include information that handlers need for referencing quickly during incident analysis. Text documents, spreadsheets, and relatively simple databases provide effective, flexible, and searchable mechanisms for sharing data among team members. 

<p>• Use Internet Search Engines for Research. Internet search engines can help analysts find information on unusual activity. Performing a search on the terms “TCP,” “port,” and “22912” may return some hits that contain logs of similar activity or even an explanation of the significance of the port number. 

<p>• Run Packet Sniffers to Collect Additional Data. Sometimes the indicators do not record enough detail to permit the handler to understand what is occurring. If an incident is occurring over a network, the fastest way to collect the necessary data may be to have a packet sniffer capture network traffic.

<li><a href="#">Every step taken from the time the incident was detected to its final resolution should be documented and timestamped. Every document regarding the incident should be dated and signed by the incident handler. Information of this nature can also be used as evidence in a court of law if legal prosecution is pursued.

<li><a href="#">Using an application or a database, such as an issue tracking system, helps ensure that incidents are handled and resolved in a timely manner. The issue tracking system should contain information on the following: 

<br>• The current status of the incident
<br>• A summary of the incident 
<br>• Indicators related to the incident 
<br>• Other incidents related to this incident
<br>• Actions taken by all incident handlers
<br>• Chain of custody, if applicable
<br>• Impact assessments related to the incident 
<br>• Contact information for other involved parties
<br>• A list of evidence gathered
<br>• Comments from incident handlers
<br>• Next steps to be taken

<li><a href="#">Prioritizing the handling of the incident is perhaps the most critical decision point in the incident handling process. Handling should be prioritized based on relevant factors, such as the following: 
<br>
<br>• Incident handlers should consider not only the current functional impact of the incident, but also the likely future functional impact of the incident if it is not immediately contained.

<br>• Information Impact of the Incident. Incident handlers should consider how this information exfiltration will impact the organization’s organization’s overall mission.

<br>• Recoverability from the Incident. Incident handlers should consider the effort necessary to actually recover from an incident and carefully weigh that against the value the recovery effort will create and any requirements related to incident handling. 

<li><a href="#">Containment is important before an incident overwhelms resources or increases damage. An essential part of containment is decision-making (e.g., shut down a system, disconnect it from a network, disable certain functions). Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident. 

<li><a href="#">In certain cases, some organizations redirect the attacker to a sandbox (a form of containment) so that they can monitor the attacker’s activity, usually to gather additional evidence. The incident response team should discuss this strategy with its legal department to determine if it is feasible.

<li><a href="#">Another potential issue regarding containment is that some attacks may cause additional damage when they are contained. When the incident handler attempts to contain the incident by disconnecting the compromised host from the network, the malicious process may overwrite or encrypt all the data on the host’s hard drive. Handlers should not assume that just because a host has been disconnected from the network, further damage to the host has been prevented. 

<li><a href="#">Evidence should be collected according to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations that have been developed from previous discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies so that any evidence can be admissible in court. In addition, evidence should be accounted for at all times; whenever evidence is transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each party’s signature.

<li><a href="#">During incident handling, system owners and others sometimes want to or need to identify the attacking host or hosts. Although this information can be important, incident handlers should generally stay focused on containment, eradication, and recovery. Identifying an attacking host can be a time-consuming and futile process that can prevent a team from achieving its primary goal— minimizing the business impact.

<li><a href="#">After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the incident, such as deleting malware and disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and mitigating all vulnerabilities that were exploited.

<li><a href="#">In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation, confirm that the systems are functioning normally, and (if applicable) remediate vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents. Recovery may involve such actions as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and tightening network perimeter security

<li><a href="#">Eradication and recovery should be done in a phased approach so that remediation steps are prioritized. For large-scale incidents, recovery may take months; the intent of the early phases should be to increase the overall security with relatively quick (days to weeks) high value changes to prevent future incidents. The later phases should focus on longer-term changes (e.g., infrastructure changes) and ongoing work to keep the enterprise as secure as possible.

<li><a href="#">One of the most important parts of incident response is also the most often omitted: learning and improving. Each incident response team should evolve to reflect new threats, improved technology, and lessons learned. Holding a “lessons learned” meeting with all involved parties after a major incident, and optionally periodically after lesser incidents as resources permit, can be extremely helpful in improving security measures and the incident handling process itself.

<li><a href="#">Lessons learned meetings provide other benefits. Reports from these meetings are good material for training new team members by showing them how more experienced team members respond to incidents. Updating incident response policies and procedures is another important part of the lessons learned process.

<li><a href="#">The most important aspect of incident response coordination is information sharing, where different organizations share threat, attack, and vulnerability information with each other so that each organization’s knowledge benefits the other. Incident information sharing is frequently mutually beneficial because the same threats and attacks often affect multiple organizations simultaneously.

<li><a href="#">While organizations gain value from collecting their own internal indicators, they may gain additional value from analyzing indicators received from partner organizations and sharing internal indicators for external analysis and use.
