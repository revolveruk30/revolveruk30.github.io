<b>FFIEC, Information Security</b>
<P>
<li><a href="#">Information security is the process by which a financial institution protects the creation, collection, storage, use, transmission, and disposal of sensitive information, including the protection of hardware and infrastructure used to store and transmit such information security exists to provide protection from malicious and non-malicious actions that increase the risk of adverse effects on earnings, capital, or enterprise value. 
<li><a href="#">The potential adverse effects can arise from the following: • Disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals. • Unavailability or degradation of services. • Misappropriation or theft of information or services. • Modification or destruction of systems or information. • Records that are not timely, accurate, complete, or consistent.
<li><a href="#">Although the use of outsourcing may change the location of certain activities from financial institutions to third-party service providers, outsourcing does not change the regulatory expectations for an effective information security program.
<li><a href="#">An institution's security culture contributes to the effectiveness of the information security program. The information security program is more effective when security processes are deeply embedded in the institution's culture.
<li><a href="#">The board and management should understand and support information security and provide appropriate resources for developing, implementing, and maintaining the information security program.
<li><a href="#">An institution with a stronger security culture generally integrates information security into new initiatives from the outset and throughout the life cycles of services and applications. Another indicator of an effective culture is whether management and employees are held accountable for complying with the institution's information security program.
<li><a href="#">The board should reasonably understand the business case for information security and the business implications of information security risks; provide management with direction; approve information security plans, policies, and programs; review assessments of the information security program's program's effectiveness; and, when appropriate, discuss management's recommendations for corrective action.
<li><a href="#">The board should provide management with its expectations and requirements and hold management accountable for central oversight and coordination, assignment of responsibility, and effectiveness of the information security program.
<li><a href="#">Funding, along with technical and managerial talent, also contributes to the effectiveness of the information security program. Management should provide, and the board should oversee, adequate funding to develop, implement, and maintain a successful information security program.
<li><a href="#">Management should integrate the information security program with the institution's lines of business and support functions. An integrated program provides management the ability to assess the likelihood and potential damage to the institution from an incident, identify the root cause(s) of the incident, and implement controls to address identified issues.
<li><a href="#">Risk is the potential that events, expected or unanticipated, may adversely affect the institution's earnings, capital, or reputation. Risk is considered in terms of categories, one of which is operational risk. Operational risk is the risk of failure or loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, or systems.
<li><a href="#">To be effective, an information security program should have documented processes to identify threats and vulnerabilities continuously. Risk identification should produce groupings of threats, including significant cybersecurity threats. A taxonomy for categorizing threats, sources, and vulnerabilities can help support the risk identification process.
<li><a href="#">The threat identification process is a means to collect data on potential threats that can assist management in its identification of information security risks. Threat modeling is a structured approach that enables an institution to aggregate and quantify potential threats.
<li><a href="#">A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to create loss. A threat can be a natural occurrence, technology or physical failure, a person with intent to harm, or a person who unintentionally causes harm.
<li><a href="#">A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system security procedure, internal control, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. A technical vulnerability can be a flaw in hardware, firmware, or software that leaves an information system open to potential exploitation.
<li><a href="#">Financial institutions connect their systems through mergers and acquisitions and through relationships with third parties. Over time, as these systems become increasingly interdependent and complex, new vulnerabilities may be introduced.
<li><a href="#">When management cannot or chooses not to mitigate a vulnerability, management should document the decision to accept the risk, the level of risk associated with the vulnerability, and the person accountable for accepting the risk.
<li><a href="#">The risk measurement process should be used to understand the institution's inherent risk and determine the risk associated with different threats. Management should use its measurement of the risks to guide its recommendations for and use of mitigating controls.
<li><a href="#">Once management has identified and measured the risks, it should develop and implement an appropriate plan to mitigate those risks. This plan should include an understanding of the extent and quality of the current control environment.
<li><a href="#">Policies, standards, and procedures guide decisions and activities of users, developers, administrators, and managers and inform those individuals of their information security responsibilities. Policies, standards, and procedures should also specify the mechanisms through which responsibilities can be met.
<li><a href="#">Information security issues arise when (a) the design of the technology and the policies governing its use do not effectively defend against identified and unidentified threats, (b) threats change in ways not envisioned by the designers, and (c) the controls are not operating as intended. Management should continually assess the capability of the institution's processes, people, and technologies to sustain the appropriate level of information security.
<li><a href="#">It is important to have a layered control system, which deploys different controls at different points of a business process and throughout an IT system so that the strength of one control can compensate for weaknesses in or possible failure of another control. Therefore, layered controls function in an integrated fashion to more effectively mitigate risk.
<li><a href="#">Management should implement controls that align security with the nature of the institution's operations and strategic direction. Based on the institution's risk assessment, the controls should include, but may not be limited to, patch management, asset and configuration management, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, end-point security, resilience controls, logging and monitoring, and secure software development.
<li><a href="#">Management should maintain and keep updated an inventory of technology assets that classifies the sensitivity and criticality of those assets, including hardware, software, information, and connections. Management should have policies to govern the inventory and classification of assets both at inception and throughout their life cycle, and wherever the assets are stored, transmitted, or processed.
<li><a href="#">Inventories are important for management to identify assets that require additional protection, such as those that store, transmit, or process sensitive customer information, trade secrets, or other information or assets that could be a target of cyber criminals.
<li><a href="#">Business processes often require institutions to share information with other institutions and third-party service providers that require connectivity.
<li><a href="#">Management should maintain network and connectivity diagrams and data flow charts to ensure adequacy of layered controls and to facilitate more timely recovery and restoration of systems when incidents occur.
<li><a href="#">Management should mitigate the risks posed by users by doing the following: • Establishing and administering security screening in IT hiring practices. • Employing segregation of duties. • Establishing and administering a user access program for physical and logical access. • Obtaining agreements covering confidentiality, nondisclosure, and authorized use. • Providing training to support awareness and policy compliance.
<li><a href="#">Management should secure access to computer networks through multiple layers of access controls by doing the following: • Establishing zones (e.g., trusted and untrusted) according to the risk profile and criticality of assets contained within the zones and appropriate access requirements within and between each security zone. • Maintaining accurate network diagrams and data flow charts. • Implementing appropriate controls over wired and wireless networks.
<li><a href="#">When deploying commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) applications and systems, management should harden the resulting applications and systems. Hardening can include the following actions:
• Configurations should be monitored for unauthorized changes, and misconfigurations should be identified. Management can use automated solutions to help track, manage, and identify necessary corrections.
•Determining the purpose of the applications and systems and documenting minimum software and hardware requirements and services to be included.
•Installing necessary patches.
•Enabling logging.
•Creating cryptographic hashes of key files.
•Changing all default passwords.
•Testing the system to ensure a secure configuration.
<li><a href="#">Consistency in system configuration makes security easier to implement and maintain. The institution should use standard builds, which allow one documented configuration to be applied to multiple computers in a controlled manner.
<li><a href="#">Management should implement automated patch management systems and software to ensure all network components (virtual machines, routers, switches, mobile devices, firewalls, etc.) are appropriately updated. In addition, management should use vulnerability scanners periodically to identify vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
<li><a href="#">Management should plan for a system's life cycle, eventual end of life, and any corresponding security and business impacts.
<li><a href="#">Security risks related to reaching a system's end of life include (a) the increased potential for vulnerabilities because the third party no longer provides patches or support, (b) incompatibility with other systems in the institution's environment, and (c) limitations in security features in older or obsolete systems.
<li><a href="#">Management should have an effective process to administer logical security access rights for the network, operating systems, applications, databases, and network devices, which should include the following: • Assigning users and devices the access required to perform required functions. • Updating access rights based on personnel or system changes. • Reviewing users' access rights at an appropriate frequency based on the risk to the application or system. • Designing appropriate acceptable-use policies and requiring users to agree to them. • Controlling privileged access. • Changing or disabling default user accounts and passwords.
<li><a href="#">Management should do the following: • Develop and maintain policies and procedures to securely offer and strengthen the resilience of remote financial services, if the institution offers such services. • Plan for actions that adversely affect the availability of remote banking services to customers. • Coordinate appropriate responses with the institution's ISPs and third-party service providers. • Regularly test the institution's response plans.
<li><a href="#">Log files are critical to the successful investigation and prosecution of security incidents and can potentially contain sensitive information. Intruders often attempt to conceal unauthorized access by editing or deleting log files. Therefore, institutions should strictly control and monitor access to log files whether on the host or in a centralized logging repository.
<li><a href="#">Risk monitoring is a process by which the institution tracks information about its inherent risk profile and identifies gaps in the effectiveness of risk mitigation activities. Risk monitoring should address changing threat conditions in both the institution and the greater financial industry.
<li><a href="#">Risk reporting is a process that produces information systems reports that address threats, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and inherent risk changes. Risk reporting should describe any information security events that the institution faces and the effectiveness of management's response and resilience to those events.
<li><a href="#">Metrics are used to measure security policy implementation, conformance with the information security program, the adequacy of security services delivery, and the impact of security events on business processes. The measurement of security characteristics can allow management to increase control and drive improvements to the security process.
<li><a href="#">Management should design policies and procedures to effectively manage security operations with the following characteristics: • Broadly scoped to address all ongoing security-related functions. • Guided by defined processes. • Integrated with lines of business and third parties. • Appropriately staffed and supplied with technology for continual incident detection and response activities.
<li><a href="#">By using a threat taxonomy, the institution may greatly reduce the complexity of threat assessment and enable efficient understanding of reasonable risk mitigations. Specific factors in the threat assessment may include a description, context for operation, capabilities and intent, and, from the threat-source perspectives, benefits and negative consequences associated with an attack.
<li><a href="#">Knowledge of threat sources is especially important to help identify vulnerabilities can occur in many areas, such as the system design, the system operation, security procedures, business line controls, and the implementation of the system and controls. Self-assessments, audits, scans, penetration tests, and reviews of SIEM reports can identify vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="#">Tools for analyzing vulnerabilities in a layered security environment include attack trees, event trees, and kill chains. These tools attempt to model an attacker's actions to enable identification of the most effective and efficient remediation options.
<li><a href="#">Technology-based indicators of compromise generally are anomalies in host state, host activity, and network traffic. A few examples are unexpected (1) processes, (2) changes to files, (3) packet source or destination, (4) protocols, (5) ports, (6) encryption, (7) log-ins, and (8) packet content. Other indicators include alerts triggered by black lists in anti-virus and network-monitoring products.
<li><a href="#">The quality of incident response is attributable to the institution's culture, policies, procedures, and training. Incident response is also a function of the relationships the institution formed before the incident with law enforcement, incident response consultants and attorneys, information-sharing entities (e.g., FS-ISAC), and others.
<li><a href="#">Assurance relates to the confidence that the information security program is mitigating risk as expected. Assurance targets two parts of the process: (1) the IT system's design and (2) the IT system's operation. The institution should carefully distinguish between the two because the former relates to risk decisions that change the security controls and the latter relates to the operation of the controls. Flaws in control design typically are corrected by a redesign, and flaws in operation typically are corrected through a compliance program.
<li><a href="#">Because knowledge of test planning and results may facilitate a security breach, the institution should carefully limit the distribution of testing information. Management should restrict test plans and data only to those individuals involved in the testing. Results should be made available in a usable form only to those responsible for following up on tests.
<li><a href="#">Independent internal departments or third parties typically perform audits should review every aspect of the information security program, the environment in which the program runs, and outputs of the program. Audits should assess the reasonableness and appropriateness of, and compliance with, policies, standards, and procedures; report on information security activity and control deficiencies to decision makers; identify root causes and recommendations to address deficiencies; and test the effectiveness of controls within the program.
<li><a href="#">&ensp; • Determine the appropriate scope and objectives for the examination.
