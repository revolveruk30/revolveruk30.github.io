<b>800-86 - Guide to Integrating Forensics into Incident Response</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#">Digital forensics, also known as computer and network forensics, has many definitions. Generally, it is considered the application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data.

<li><a href="#">The forensic process comprises the following basic phases:

<li><a href="#">• Collection. The first phase in the process is to identify, label, record, and acquire data from the possible sources of relevant data, while following guidelines and procedures that preserve the integrity of the data. 

<li><a href="#">• Examination. Examinations involve forensically processing large amounts of collected data using a combination of automated and manual methods to assess and extract data of particular interest. 

<li><a href="#">• Analysis. The next phase of the process is to analyze the results of the examination, using legally justifiable methods and techniques, to derive useful information that addresses the questions that were the impetus for performing the collection and examination. 

<li><a href="#">• Reporting. The final phase is reporting the results of the analysis, which may include describing the actions used, explaining how tools and procedures were selected, determining what other actions need to be performed, and providing recommendations for improvement to policies, guidelines, procedures, tools, and other aspects of the forensic process.

<li><a href="#">Many incidents can be handled more efficiently and effectively if forensic considerations have been incorporated into the information system life cycle. Examples of such considerations are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Performing regular backups of systems and maintaining previous backups for a specific period of time

<li><a href="#">• Enabling auditing on workstations, servers, and network devices 

<li><a href="#">• Forwarding audit records to secure centralized log servers 

<li><a href="#">• Maintaining a database of file hashes for the files of common OS and application deployments

<li><a href="#">• Maintaining records (e. g., baselines) of network and system configurations

<li><a href="#">Organizations should consider developing step-by-step procedures for performing routine tasks, such as imaging a hard disk, capturing and recording volatile information from systems, or securing physical evidence (e. g., removable media). The goal for the guidelines and procedures is to facilitate consistent, effective, and accurate forensic actions, which is particularly important for incidents that may lead to prosecution or internal disciplinary actions.

<li><a href="#">The most common goal of performing forensics is to gain a better understanding of an event of interest by finding and analyzing the facts related to that event.

<li><a href="#">During collection, data related to a specific event is identified, labeled, recorded, and collected, and its integrity is preserved. In the second phase, examination, forensic tools and techniques appropriate to the types of data that were collected are executed to identify and extract the relevant information from the collected data while protecting its integrity.

<li><a href="#">The next phase, analysis, involves analyzing the results of the examination to derive useful information that addresses the questions that were the impetus for performing the collection and examination. The final phase involves reporting the results of the analysis, which may include describing the actions performed, determining what other actions need to be performed, and recommending improvements to policies, guidelines, procedures, tools, and other aspects of the forensic process.

<li><a href="#">The first transformation occurs when collected data is examined, which extracts data from media and transforms it into a format that can be processed by forensic tools. Second, data is transformed into information through analysis. Finally, information is transformed into evidence during the reporting phase.

<li><a href="#">Data acquisition should be performed using a three-step process: developing a plan to acquire the data, acquiring the data, and verifying the integrity of the acquired data. 

<li><a href="#">Develop a plan to acquire the data. Developing a plan is an important first step in most cases because there are multiple potential data sources. The analyst should create a plan that prioritizes the sources, establishing the order in which the data should be acquired. Important factors for prioritization include the following: 

<li><a href="#">• Likely Value. Based on the analyst’s understanding of the situation and previous experience in similar situations, the analyst should be able to estimate the relative likely value of each potential data source. 

<li><a href="#">• Volatility. Volatile data refers to data on a live system that is lost after a computer is powered down or due to the passage of time. In many cases, acquiring volatile data should be given priority over non-volatile data.

<li><a href="#">• Amount of Effort Required. The amount of effort required to acquire different data sources may vary widely. For example, acquiring data from a network router would probably require much less effort than acquiring data from an ISP.

<li><a href="#">Acquire the data. If the data has not already been acquired by security tools, analysis tools, or other means, the general process for acquiring data involves using forensic tools to collect volatile data, duplicating non-volatile data sources to collect their data, and securing the original non-volatile data sources. 

<li><a href="#">Verify the integrity of the data. After the data has been acquired, its integrity should be verified. It is particularly important for an analyst to prove that the data has not been tampered with if it might be needed for legal reasons.

<li><a href="#">Throughout the process, a detailed log should be kept of every step that was taken to collect the data, including information about each tool used in the process. The documentation allows other analysts to repeat the process later if needed.

<li><a href="#">In addition, before actually touching a system, the analyst should make a note or photograph of any pictures, documents, running programs, and other relevant information displayed on the monitor. 

<li><a href="#">After data has been collected, the next phase is to examine the data, which involves assessing and extracting the relevant pieces of information from the collected data. 

<li><a href="#">Text and pattern searches can be used to identify pertinent data, such as finding documents that mention a particular subject or person, or identifying e-mail log entries for a particular e-mail address. Knowledge of data file types can be used to identify files that merit further study, as well as to exclude files that are of no interest to the examination.

<li><a href="#">Once the relevant information has been extracted, the analyst should study and analyze the data to draw conclusions from it. The foundation of forensics is using a methodical approach to reach appropriate conclusions based on the available data.

<li><a href="#">Often, this effort will include correlating data among multiple sources. For instance, a network intrusion detection system (IDS) log may link an event to a host, the host audit logs may link the event to a specific user account, and the host IDS log may indicate what actions that user performed. Tools such as centralized logging and security event management software can facilitate this process by automatically gathering and correlating the data.

<li><a href="#">The final phase is reporting, which is the process of preparing and presenting the information resulting from the analysis phase. Many factors affect reporting, including the following: 

<li><a href="#">• Alternative Explanations. When an event has two or more plausible explanations, each should be given due consideration in the reporting process. Analysts should use a methodical approach to attempt to prove or disprove each possible explanation that is proposed. 

<li><a href="#">• Audience Consideration. Knowing the audience to which the data or information will be shown is important. An incident requiring law enforcement involvement requires highly detailed reports of all information gathered, and may also require copies of all evidentiary data obtained.

<li><a href="#">• Actionable Information. Reporting also includes identifying actionable information gained from data that may allow an analyst to collect new sources of information. 

<li><a href="#">If evidence may be needed for prosecution or disciplinary actions, the analyst should get a bit stream image of the original media, label the original media, and store it securely as evidence. All subsequent analysis should be performed using the copied media to ensure that the original media is not modified and that a copy of the original media can always be recreated if necessary.

<li><a href="#">During backups and imaging, the integrity of the original media should be maintained. To ensure that the backup or imaging process does not alter data on the original media, analysts can use a write-blocker while backing up or imaging the media. A write-blocker is a hardware or software-based tool that prevents a computer from writing to computer storage media connected to it.

<li><a href="#">It is often important to know when a file was created, used, or manipulated, and most OSs keep track of certain timestamps related to files. The most commonly used timestamps are the modification, access, and creation (MAC) times, as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Modification Time. This is the last time a file was changed in any way.

<li><a href="#">• Access Time. This is the last time any access was performed on a file (e. g., viewed, opened, printed). 

<li><a href="#">• Creation Time. This is generally the time and date the file was created; however, when a file is copied to a system, the creation time will become the time the file was copied to the new system.

<li><a href="#">Analysts should also be aware that file times may not always be accurate. Among the reasons for such inaccuracies are the following:

<li><a href="#">• The computer’s clock does not have the correct time.
<li><a href="#">• The time may not be recorded with the expected level of detail.
<li><a href="#">• An attacker may have altered the recorded file times.

<li><a href="#">After restoring the backup (if needed), the analyst begins to examine the collected data and performs an assessment of the relevant files and data by locating files, including deleted files, remnants of files in slack and free space, and hidden files. Next, the analyst may need to extract the data from some or all of the files, which may be complicated by such measures as encryption and password protection.

<li><a href="#">To make sense of the contents of a file, an analyst needs to know what type of data the file contains. The intended purpose of file extensions is to denote the nature of the file’s contents. However, users can assign any file extension to any type of file, or omitting a file extension. Therefore, analysts should not assume that file extensions are accurate. 

<li><a href="#">Analysts can more accurately identify the type of data stored in many files by looking at their file headers. A file header contains identifying information about a file and possibly metadata that provides information about the file’s contents.

<li><a href="#">The following processes are among those that an analyst should be able to perform with a variety of tools:

<li><a href="#">• Using file viewers instead of the original source applications to display the contents of certain types of files is an important technique for scanning or previewing data, and is more efficient because the analyst does not need native applications for viewing each type of file.

<li><a href="#">• Uncompressing files should be performed early in the forensic process to ensure that the contents of compressed files are included in searches and other actions. However, analysts should keep in mind that compressed files might contain malicious content.

<li><a href="#">• Graphically Displaying Directory Structures. This practice makes it easier and faster for analysts to gather general information about the contents of media, such as the type of software installed and the likely technical aptitude of the user(s) who created the data. 

<li><a href="#">• The benefit of finding files of interest is obvious, but it is also often beneficial to eliminate unimportant files, such as known good OS and application files, from consideration. Analysts should use validated hash sets, such as those created by NIST’s National Software Reference Library (NSRL) project or personally created hash sets that have been validated, as a basis for identifying known benign and malicious files. 

<li><a href="#">• String searches aid in perusing large amounts of data to find key words or strings. Various searching tools are available that can use Boolean, fuzzy logic, synonyms and concepts, stemming, and other search methods. Developing concise sets of search terms for common situations can help the analyst reduce the volume of information to review.

<li><a href="#">• Accessing File Metadata. File metadata provides details about any given file. For example, collecting the metadata on a graphic file might provide the graphic’s creation date, copyright information, and description, and the creator’s identity.

<li><a href="#">Knowing when an incident occurred, a file was created or modified, or an e-mail was sent can be critical to forensic analysis. For example, such information can be used to reconstruct a timeline of activities. 

<li><a href="#">OS data exists in both non-volatile and volatile states. Non-volatile data refers to data that persists even after a computer is powered down, such as a filesystem stored on a hard drive. Volatile data refers to data on a live system that is lost after a computer is powered down, such as the current network connections to and from the system. 

<li><a href="#">The primary source of non-volatile data within an OS is the filesystem. The filesystem is also usually the largest and richest source of data within the OS, containing most of the information recovered during a typical forensic event.

<li><a href="#">Several types of data that are commonly found within OS filesystems are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">The OS may use configuration files to store OS and application settings. For example, configuration files could list the services to be started automatically after system boot, and specify the location of log files and temporary files. 

<li><a href="#">Configuration files of particular interest are as follows:

<li><a href="#">• The OS keeps a record of its user accounts and groups. Account information may include group membership, account name and description, account permissions, account status (e. g., active, disabled).

<li><a href="#">• The OS may store password hashes in data files. Various password-cracking utilities may be used to convert a password hash to its clear text equivalent for certain OSs. 

<li><a href="#">• The OS maintains a list of scheduled tasks that are to be performed automatically at a certain time (e. g., perform a virus scan every week). Information that can be gleaned from this include the task name, the program used to perform the task, command line switches and arguments, and the days and times when the task is to be performed. 

<li><a href="#">OS log files contain information about various OS events, and may also hold application-specific event information. The types of information typically found in OS logs are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">System events are operational actions performed by OS components, such as shutting down the system or starting a service. Each event is usually timestamped; other supporting information could include event codes, status codes, and username. 

<li><a href="#">Audit records contain security event information such as successful and failed authentication attempts and security policy changes.

<li><a href="#">Application events are significant operational actions performed by applications, such as application startup and shutdown, application failures, and major application configuration changes.

<li><a href="#">Command History. Some OSs have separate log files (typically for each user) that contain a history of the OS commands performed by each user. 

<li><a href="#">Recently Accessed Files. An OS might log the most recent file accesses or other usage, creating a list of the most recently accessed files. 

<li><a href="#">Application Files can be composed of many types of files, including executables, scripts, documentation, configuration files, log files, history files, graphics, sounds, and icons. 

<li><a href="#">Data files store information for applications. Examples of common data files are text files, word processing documents, spreadsheets, databases, audio files, and graphics files.

<li><a href="#">Swap Files. Most OSs use swap files in conjunction with RAM to provide temporary storage for data often used by applications.

<li><a href="#">Dump Files. Some OSs have the ability to store the contents of memory automatically during an error condition to assist in subsequent troubleshooting.

<li><a href="#">A hibernation file is created to preserve the current state of a system (typically a laptop) by recording memory and open files before shutting off the system. When the system is next turned on, the state of the system is restored. 

<li><a href="#">Temporary Files. During the installation of an OS, application, or OS or application updates and upgrades, temporary files are often created. Although such files are typically deleted at the end of the installation process, this does not always occur. 

<li><a href="#">OSs execute within the RAM of a system. While the OS is functioning, the contents of RAM are constantly changing. RAM often contains frequently and recently accessed data, such as data files, password hashes, and recent commands.

<li><a href="#">Some other significant types of volatile data that might exist within an OS are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Network Configuration. Many hosts are assigned Internet Protocol (IP) addresses dynamically by another host, meaning that their IP addresses are not part of the stored configuration. Users also may be able to alter network interface configurations from the defaults, such as manually changing IP addresses. Accordingly, analysts should use the current network configuration, not the stored configuration, whenever possible. 

<li><a href="#">• Processes are the programs that are currently executing on a computer. Most OSs offer ways to view a list of the currently running processes. This list can be studied to determine the services that are active on the system, such as a Web server, and the programs that individual users are running.

<li><a href="#">• Volatile OS data involving an event can be collected only from a live system that has not been rebooted or shut down since the event occurred. Every action performed on the system, whether initiated by a person or by the OS itself, will almost certainly alter the volatile OS data in some way. Therefore, analysts should decide as quickly as possible whether the volatile OS data should be preserved.

<li><a href="#">• The analyst should know how each tool affects or alters the system before collecting the volatile data. The message digest of each tool should be computed and stored safely to verify file integrity. Licensing and version information also should be documented for each forensic tool. In addition, the exact commands that were used to run each forensic tool should be documented (i. e., command line arguments and switches).

<li><a href="#">The following list shows several types of volatile OS data and explains how forensic tools can be used in collecting each type of data:

<li><a href="#">• Contents of Memory. There are several utilities that can copy the contents of RAM to a data file and assist in subsequent analysis of the data. On most systems, it is not possible to avoid alteration of RAM when running a utility that attempts to make a copy of RAM. Instead, the goal is to perform the copying with as small a footprint as possible to minimize the disruption of RAM.

<li><a href="#">• Network Configuration. Most OSs include a utility that displays the current network configuration, such as ifconfig on UNIX systems and ipconfig on Windows systems. Information that can be provided through network configuration utilities includes the hostname, the physical and logical network interfaces, and configuration information for each interface (e. g., IP address, Media Access Control [ MAC] address, current status). 

<li><a href="#">• Network Connections. OSs typically provide a method for displaying a list of the current network connections. Both Windows and UNIX-based systems usually include the netstat program, which lists network connections by source and destination IP addresses and ports, and also lists which ports are open on each interface.

<li><a href="#">• Running Processes. All UNIX-based systems offer the ps command for displaying currently running processes. Although Windows offers a graphical user interface (GUI) –based process list utility, the Task Manager, it is usually preferable to have a text-based listing.

<li><a href="#">• Open Files. All UNIX-based systems offer the lsof command for displaying a list of open files. Third-party utilities can be used to generate text lists of open files for Windows systems. 

<li><a href="#">• Login Sessions. Some OSs have built-in commands for listing the currently logged on users, such as the w command for UNIX systems, which also lists the source address of each user and when the user logged onto the system.

<li><a href="#">• Operating System Time. There are several utilities available for retrieving the current system time zone information, and daylight savings time settings. On UNIX systems, the date command can be used to retrieve this information. On Windows systems, the date, time, and nlsinfo commands can be used collectively to retrieve this information. 

<li><a href="#">In addition to the tools in the preceding list, it is often useful to include some general-purpose tools in the forensic toolkit, such as the following: 

<li><a href="#">• OS Command Prompt. This utility provides an OS command prompt through which the other tools in the toolkit can be executed, such as cmd on Windows systems. 

<li><a href="#">• SHA-1 Checksum. A utility that can compute the SHA-1 message digest of data files is helpful in file verification.

<li><a href="#">• Directory List. A utility for listing the contents of directories should be included for navigating a filesystem and seeing its contents. Practically OSs include such a utility; for example, the ls command is used on UNIX systems, whereas on Windows systems, the dir command is used. 

<li><a href="#">• String Search. A utility for performing a text string search can be useful in identifying data files of interest. UNIX systems offer the grep command for performing text string searches, and a third-party grep utility is also available on Windows systems.

<li><a href="#">• Text Editor. A simple text editor can be useful for viewing text files or composing notes. Numerous text editors are available, such as Notepad on Windows systems and vi on UNIX systems. 

<li><a href="#">If a network intrusion is suspected, it might be useful to collect network configuration information, network connections, login sessions, and running processes to determine how someone gained access to a system. If an investigation concerns identity theft, then the contents of RAM, the list of running processes, and a list of open files would also be collected.

<li><a href="#">Programs used to obtain or encrypt data, password hashes, and methods that might have been used to obtain the information over a network. When in doubt, it is usually a good idea to collect as much volatile data as possible because all opportunities to collect such data will be lost once the computer is powered down. 

<li><a href="#">Because volatile data has a propensity to change over time, the order and timeliness with which volatile data is collected is important. In most cases, analysts should first collect information on network connections and login sessions, because network connections may time out or be disconnected and the list of users connected to a system at any single time may vary. 

<li><a href="#">The recommended order in which volatile data generally should be collected, from first to last, is as follows: 1. Network connections 2. Login sessions 3. Contents of memory 4. Running processes 5. Open files 6. Network configuration 7. Operating system time. 

<li><a href="#">After obtaining volatile OS data, analysts often should collect non-volatile OS data. To do so, the analyst first should decide whether the system should be shut down.

<li><a href="#">Perform a Graceful OS Shutdown. This causes the OS to perform cleanup activities, such as closing open files, deleting temporary files, and possibly clearing the swap file, before shutting down the system. 

<li><a href="#">Remove Power from the System. Disconnecting the power cord from the back of the computer can preserve swap files, temporary data files, and other information that might be altered or deleted during a graceful shutdown. Unfortunately, a sudden loss of power can cause some OSs to corrupt data, such as open files.

<li><a href="#">The following list describes several other types of non-volatile OS data and explains how tools can be useful in acquiring each type from the filesystem:

<li><a href="#">Users and Groups. Operating systems maintain a list of users and groups that have access to the system. On UNIX systems, users and groups are listed in /etc/ passwd and /etc/ groups, respectively. In addition, the groups and users commands can be used to identify users who have logged onto the system and the groups to which they belong. On Windows systems, the net user and net group commands can be used to enumerate the users and groups on a system. 

<li><a href="#">Passwords. Most OSs maintain password hashes for users’passwords on disk. On Windows systems, third-party utilities can be used to dump password hashes from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database. On UNIX systems, password hashes are usually in the /etc/ passwd or /etc/ shadow file. 

<li><a href="#">Network Shares. A system may enable local resources to be shared across a network. On Windows systems, the SrvCheck utility can be used to list network shares. Third-party utilities can provide similar information for other OSs. 

<li><a href="#">Logs that are not stored in text files might necessitate use of log extraction utilities. For example, specialized utilities can retrieve information about recent successful and failed logon attempts on Windows systems, which are stored in binary format logs. Most log entries on Unix systems are stored in text files by syslog or in the /var/ log directory, so special utilities are not needed to acquire information from the logs.

<li><a href="#">The application layer enables applications to transfer data between an application server and client. An example of an application layer protocol is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which transfers data between a Web server and a Web browser. Other common application layer protocols include Domain Name System (DNS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Regardless of the protocol in use, application data is generated and then passed to the transport layer for further processing. 

<li><a href="#">The transport layer is responsible for packaging data so that it can be transmitted between hosts. After the transport layer has encapsulated application data, the resulting logical units are referred to as packets. Each packet contains a header, which is composed of various fields that specify characteristics of the transport protocol in use; optionally, packets may also contain a payload, which holds the application data.

<li><a href="#">Most applications that communicate over networks rely on the transport layer to ensure reliable delivery of data. Generally, this is accomplished by using the TCP transport layer protocol, which establishes a connection between two hosts and then makes a best effort to ensure the reliable transfer of data over that connection.

<li><a href="#">The IP layer can also be called the network layer, because it is responsible for handling the addressing and routing of data that it receives from the transport layer. The IP header contains a field called IP Version, which indicates which version of IP is in use.

<li><a href="#">The hardware layer provides information about physical components, while other layers describe logical aspects. For events within a network, an analyst can map an IP address (logical identifier at the IP layer) to the MAC address of a particular NIC (physical identifier at the physical layer), thereby identifying a host of interest. 

<li><a href="#">When analysts begin to examine data, they typically have limited information — most likely an IP address of interest and perhaps protocol and port information. Nevertheless, this is enough information to support searching common data sources for more information. In most cases, the application layer contains the actual activity of interest — most attacks are against vulnerabilities in applications (including services), and nearly all misuse involves misuse of applications. 

<li><a href="#">For each suspicious event, IDS software typically records the same basic event characteristics that firewalls and routers record (e. g., date and time, source and destination IP addresses, protocol, basic protocol characteristics), as well as application-specific information (e. g., username, filename, command, status code).

<li><a href="#">Security event management (SEM) software is capable of importing security event information from various network traffic – related security event data sources (e. g., IDS logs, firewall logs) and correlating events among the sources. It generally works by receiving copies of logs from various data sources over secure channels, normalizing the logs into a standard format, then identifying related events by matching IP addresses, timestamps, and other characteristics.

<li><a href="#">Many SEM products not only can identify malicious activity, such as attacks and virus infections, but also can detect misuse and inappropriate usage of systems and networks. SEM software can be helpful in making many sources of network traffic information accessible through a single interface. 

<li><a href="#">Network forensic analysis tools (NFAT) typically provide the same functionality as packet sniffers, protocol analyzers, and SEM software in a single product. Whereas SEM software concentrates on correlating events among existing data sources (which typically include multiple network traffic – related sources), NFAT software focuses primarily on collecting, examining, and analyzing network traffic. NFAT software also offers additional features that further facilitate network forensics, such as the following: 

<li><a href="#">• Reconstructing events by replaying network traffic within the tool, ranging from an individual session to all sessions during a particular time period.

<li><a href="#">• Visualizing the traffic flows and the relationships among hosts. 

<li><a href="#">• Building profiles of typical activity and identifying significant deviations. 

<li><a href="#">• Searching application content for keywords (e. g., 'confidential'). 

<li><a href="#">Most organizations have other sources of network traffic information that can be of use for forensics in some capacity, including the following: 

<li><a href="#">The DHCP service assigns IP addresses to hosts on a network as needed. Some hosts might have static IP addresses, which means that they always receive the same IP address assignment; however, most hosts typically receive dynamic assignments. DHCP servers may contain assignment logs that include the MAC address, the IP address assigned to that MAC address, and the time the assignment occurred. 

<li><a href="#">Network monitoring software is designed to observe network traffic and gather statistics about it. For example, it may record high-level information about traffic flows for a particular network segment, such as the amount of bandwidth typically consumed by various protocols.

<li><a href="#">Several technical issues might impede the collection of data about network traffic.

<li><a href="#">• Data Storage. When there is a large volume of network activity, particularly during adverse events such as attacks, logs may record many events in a short time. If insufficient storage is available, information about recent activity may be overwritten and lost. Organizations should estimate typical and peak log usage, determine how many hours’or days’worth of data should be retained, and ensure that systems and applications have sufficient storage available to meet those goals.

<li><a href="#">• Encrypted Traffic. When protocols such as IP Security (IPsec), SSH, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are used to encrypt network traffic, devices monitoring network traffic along the encrypted path can see only the most basic characteristics of the traffic, such as source and destination IP addresses. 

<li><a href="#">• Services Running on Unexpected Ports. Applications such as IDSs and protocol analyzers often rely on port numbers to identify which service is in use for a given connection. 

<li><a href="#">There are several ways to attempt to identify unexpected port usage, including the following: 1. Configuring IDS sensors to alert on connections involving unknown server ports. 2. Performing traffic flow monitoring and identifying new and unusual traffic flows.

<li><a href="#">Although current tools can be helpful in gathering and presenting network traffic data, such tools have rather limited analysis abilities and can be used effectively only by well-trained, experienced analysts. In addition to understanding the tools, analysts should also have reasonably comprehensive knowledge of networking principles, common network and application protocols, network and application security products, and network-based threats and attack methods. 

<li><a href="#">It is also very important that analysts have knowledge of the organization’s environment, such as the network architecture and the IP addresses used by critical assets as well as knowledge of the information supporting the applications and OSs used by the organization.

<li><a href="#">The first step in the examination process is the identification of an event of interest. Typically, this identification is made through one of two methods:

<li><a href="#">• Someone within the organization (e. g., help desk agent, system administrator, security administrator) receives an indication, such as an automated alert or a user complaint, that there is a security or operational-related issue. The analyst is asked to research the corresponding activity. 

<li><a href="#">• During a review of security event data (e. g., IDS monitoring, network monitoring, firewall log review), which is part of the analyst’s regular duties, the analyst identifies an event of interest and determines that it should be researched further.

<li><a href="#">In most cases, the event will have been detected through a network traffic data source, such as an IDS sensor or a firewall, so the analyst can simply be pointed to that data source for more information. However, in some cases, such as a user complaint, it might not be apparent which data sources (if any) contain relevant information or which hosts or networks might be involved. Therefore, analysts might need to rely on more general information — for example, reports that several systems on the fourth floor have been rebooting themselves.

<li><a href="#">For each data source examined, analysts should consider its fidelity. In general, analysts should have more confidence in original data sources than in data sources that receive normalized (modified) data from other sources. In addition, analysts should validate data that is based on interpretation, such as IDS and SEM alerts. 

<li><a href="#">Validation should be based on an analysis of additional data (e. g., raw packets, supporting information captured by other sources), a review of available information on alert validity (e. g., vendor comments on known false positives), and past experience with the tool in question. 

<li><a href="#">Analysts may also need to examine secondary network traffic data sources, such as host-based firewall logs and packet captures, and non-network traffic data sources, such as host OS audit logs and antivirus software logs. The most common reasons for doing this are as follows:

<li><a href="#">• No Data on Primary Sources. In some cases, the typical primary network traffic data sources do not contain evidence of the activity. For example, an attack might have occurred between two hosts on an internal network segment that is not monitored or controlled by network security devices. 

<li><a href="#">• Insufficient or Unvalidated Data on Primary Sources. Analysts might need to examine secondary data sources if primary data sources do not contain sufficient information or analysts need to validate the data. Analysts also use timestamps, protocols, port numbers, and other common data fields to narrow their search as necessary. 

<li><a href="#">If additional data is needed but cannot be located and the suspicious activity is still occurring, analysts might need to perform more data collection activities. For example, an analyst could perform packet captures at an appropriate point on the network to gather more information. Other ways to collect more information include configuring firewalls or routers to log more information on certain activity.

<li><a href="#">The following items describe the typical value of the most common data sources in network forensics: 

<li><a href="#">• IDS Software. IDS data is often the starting point for examining suspicious activity. Not only do IDSs typically attempt to identify malicious network traffic at all TCP/ IP layers, but also they log many data fields (and sometimes raw packets) that can be useful in validating events and correlating them with other data sources. Nevertheless, as noted previously, IDS software does produce false positives, so IDS alerts should be validated. 

<li><a href="#">• SEM Software. Ideally, SEM can be extremely useful for forensics because it can automatically correlate events among several data sources, then extract the relevant information and present it to the user. However, because SEM software functions by bringing in data from many other sources, the value of SEM depends on which data sources are fed into it, how reliable each data source is, and how well the software can normalize the data and correlate events. 

<li><a href="#">• NFAT software is designed specifically to aid in network traffic analysis, so it is valuable if it has monitored an event of interest. NFAT software usually offers features that support analysis, such as traffic reconstruction and visualization.

<li><a href="#">• Firewalls, Routers, Proxy Servers, and Remote Access Servers. By itself, data from these sources is usually of little value. The primary value of the data is to correlate events recorded by other sources.

<li><a href="#">• DHCP servers typically can be configured to log each IP address assignment and the associated MAC address, along with a timestamp. This information can be helpful to analysts in identifying which host performed an activity using a particular IP address. However, analysts should be mindful of the possibility that attackers on an organization’s internal networks falsified their MAC addresses or IP addresses, a practice known as spoofing. 

<li><a href="#">• Of all the network traffic data sources, packet sniffers can collect the most information on network activity. In most cases, packet sniffers are best used to provide more data on events that other devices or software has identified as possibly malicious. 

<li><a href="#">• Network monitoring software is helpful in identifying significant deviations from normal traffic flows, such as those caused by DDoS attacks. Traffic flow data can also be helpful in investigating suspicious activity identified by other sources. For example, it might indicate whether a particular communications pattern has occurred in the preceding days or weeks. 

<li><a href="#">• ISP Records. Information from an ISP is primarily of value in tracing an attack back to its source, particularly when the attack uses spoofed IP addresses. 

<li><a href="#">When a manual data review is not possible or practical, analysts should use an automated solution that filters the events and presents the analysts with only the events that are most likely to be of interest. One effective review technique is to import the logs into a database and run queries against them, either eliminating types of activity highly likely to be benign and reviewing the rest, or focusing on the types of activity most likely to be malicious.

<li><a href="#">Another analysis option is to use a visualization tool. These tools present security event data in a graphical format. This is most often used to represent network traffic flows visually, which can be very helpful in troubleshooting operational issues and identifying misuse. 

<li><a href="#">Generally, analysts should think of the analysis process as a methodical approach that develops conclusions based on the data that is available and assumptions regarding the missing data (which should be based on technical knowledge and expertise).

<li><a href="#">The analyst should eventually locate, validate, and analyze enough data to be able to reconstruct the event, understand its significance, and determine its impact.

<li><a href="#">Determining the identity of an external attacker, are typically time-intensive and difficult to accomplish, and do not aid the organization in correcting the operational issues or security weaknesses. 

<li><a href="#">Although understanding intent is important in some cases, the negative impact of the event should be the primary concern. The focus of the investigation should be determined at the onset by the appropriate parties, who should decide if learning the identity of the attacker is vital. 

<li><a href="#">Organizations should be interested not only in analyzing real events, but also in understanding the causes of false alarms. For example, analysts are often well-positioned to identify the root causes of IDS false positives. As merited, analysts should recommend changes to security event data sources that improve detection accuracy. 

<li><a href="#">Several ways of validating the identity of a suspicious host are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Contact the IP Address Owner. The Regional Internet Registries, such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), provide WHOIS query mechanisms on their Web sites for identifying the organization or person that owns — is responsible for — a particular IP address. 

<li><a href="#">• Seek ISP Assistance. ISPs generally require a court order before providing any information to an organization about suspicious network activity. Accordingly, ISP assistance is generally an option during only the most serious network-based attacks. This assistance is particularly useful in relation to attacks that involve IP address spoofing. ISPs have the ability to trace ongoing attacks back to their source, whether the IP addresses are spoofed or not. 

<li><a href="#">• Research the History of the IP Address. Analysts can look for previous suspicious activity associated with the same IP address or IP address block. The organization’s own network traffic data archives and incident tracking databases might show previous activity. Possible external sources include Internet search engines and online incident databases that allow searches by IP address.

<li><a href="#">Most applications allow users or administrators to customize certain aspects of the application’s behavior by altering configuration settings. Configuration settings may be stored in several ways, including the following: 

<li><a href="#">• Configuration File. Applications may store settings in a text file or a file with a proprietary binary format. Some applications require the configuration file to be on the same host as the application.

<li><a href="#">• Added to Source Code. Some applications that make source code available (e. g., open source applications, scripts) actually place user or administrator-specified configuration settings directly into the source code. In some cases, the settings can be found by searching for text strings within the executable files.

<li><a href="#">An application may record log entries to an OS-specific log (e. g., syslog on UNIX systems, event logs on Windows systems), a text file, a database, or a proprietary file format. Common types of log entries are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Event log entries typically list actions that were performed, the date and time each action occurred, and the result of each action. Examples of actions that might be recorded are establishing a connection to another system and issuing administrator-level commands.

<li><a href="#">• Audit log entries, also known as security log entries, contain information pertaining to audited activities, such as successful and failed logon attempts, security policy changes, file access, and process execution.

<li><a href="#">• Error. Some applications create error logs, which record information regarding application errors, typically with timestamps. Error logs are helpful in troubleshooting both operational issues and attacks.

<li><a href="#">• Installation. An application may create a separate installation log file that records information pertinent to the initial installation and subsequent updates of that application. 

<li><a href="#">• Debugging. Some applications can be run in a debugging mode, which means that they log far more information than usual regarding the operation of the application. 

<li><a href="#">Although forensic techniques can be applied to any application, certain types of applications are more likely to be the focus of forensic analysis, including e-mail, Web usage, interactive messaging, file sharing, document usage, security applications, and data concealment tools. Nearly every computer has at least a few applications installed from these categories. 

<li><a href="#">Information that may be retrieved from Web browsers include a list of favorite Web sites, a history (with timestamps) of Web sites visited, cached Web data files, and cookies (including their creation and expiration dates).

<li><a href="#">Data that is often logged by Web servers for each request includes a timestamp; the IP address, Web browser version, and OS of the host making the request; the type of request (e. g., read data, write data); the resource requested; and the status code. 

<li><a href="#">The incident handler should check the data sources that are most likely to have relevant information first, based on the handler’s previous experience with the data sources and the initial information available regarding the incident. 

<li><a href="#">If a centralized source of data is not available, the handler should check individual potential sources of attack characteristics, such as the following: 

<li><a href="#">• Network IDS. At a minimum, the data should indicate which server was attacked and on what port number, which indicates which network service was targeted. Identifying the service is very important to finding the exploited vulnerability and developing a mitigation strategy to prevent similar incidents from occurring on other systems.

<li><a href="#">• Network-Based Firewall. Firewalls are typically configured to log blocked connection attempts, including the intended destination IP address and port. If firewalls are configured to record permitted connections, their logs may show which hosts within the organization have received worm traffic or been infected and generated their own worm traffic. This is particularly useful for situations in which network IDS sensors do not monitor all traffic that reaches the firewall. 

<li><a href="#">• Host IDS and Firewall. IDS and firewall products running on the infected system may contain more detailed information than network IDS and firewall products. For example, a host IDS can identify changes to files or configuration settings on the host.

<li><a href="#">• Application logs record extensive details on the application-specific characteristics of the activity, and are particularly helpful at identifying attack characteristics from less common applications. 

<li><a href="#">Analysts can perform queries on antivirus vendors’malware databases, searching for identified characteristics such as product name, service name or port number, text strings within the malware, and files or settings modified on the target. Virtually any instance of malware, other than the latest threats (e. g., released in the past several hours), is likely to be included in major malware databases.

<li><a href="#">To gather more information, the analyst can examine the infection through the following methods: 

<li><a href="#">Current State of the Host. The analyst can examine the host to look at several aspects of its current state. In this case, it is probably most effective to examine the network connections listing to identify unusual connections (e. g., large number, unexpected port number usage, unexpected hosts) and unexpected listening ports (e. g., backdoors created by the worm). Other steps that may be useful include identifying unknown processes in the running processes list and examining the host’s logs to reveal any unusual entries that may be related to the infection.

<li><a href="#">Host’s Network Activity. The analyst can collect worm traffic being generated by the infected server through a packet sniffer and protocol analyzer. This may provide enough additional information regarding the characteristics of the worm to enable the analyst to locate it in major malware databases.
