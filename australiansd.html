<li><a href="#">A CISO is appointed to provide cyber security leadership and guidance for their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO oversees their organisation's cyber security program and ensures their organisation's compliance with cyber security policy, standards, regulations and legislation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO regularly reviews and updates their organisation's cyber security program to ensure its relevance in addressing cyber threats and harnessing business and cyber security opportunities.

<li><a href="#">The CISO implements cyber security measurement metrics and key performance indicators for their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO coordinates cyber security and business alignment through a cyber security steering committee or advisory board, comprising of key cyber security and business executives, which meets formally and on a regular basis.

<li><a href="#">The CISO coordinates security risk management activities between cyber security and business teams.

<li><a href="#">The CISO reports directly to their organisation's senior executive or Board on cyber security matters.

<li><a href="#">The CISO is fully aware of all cyber security incidents within their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO oversees their organisation's response to cyber security incidents.

<li><a href="#">The CISO contributes to the development and maintenance of business continuity and disaster recovery plans for their organisation to ensure that business-critical services are supported appropriately in the event of a disaster.

<li><a href="#">The CISO develops and maintains a cyber security communications strategy for their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO oversees cyber supply chain risk management activities for their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO receives and manages a dedicated cyber security budget for their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO oversees the management of cyber security personnel within their organisation.

<li><a href="#">The CISO oversees the development and operation of their organisation's cyber security awareness training program.

<li><a href="#">Each system has a designated system owner.

<li><a href="#">System owners register each system with its authorising officer.

<li><a href="#">System owners determine the type, value and security objectives for each system based on an assessment of the impact if it were to be compromised.

<li><a href="#">System owners select controls for each system and tailor them to achieve desired security objectives.

<li><a href="#">System owners implement controls for each system and its operating environment.

<li><a href="#">System owners ensure controls for each system and its operating environment are assessed to determine if they have been implemented correctly and are operating as intended.

<li><a href="#">System owners obtain authorisation to operate each system from its authorising officer based on the acceptance of the security risks associated with its operation.

<li><a href="#">System owners monitor each system, and associated cyber threats, security risks and controls, on an ongoing basis.

<li><a href="#">System owners report the security status of each system to its authorising officer at least annually.

<li><a href="#">An intrusion detection and prevention policy is developed and implemented.

<li><a href="#">A trusted insider program is developed and implemented.

<li><a href="#">Legal advice is sought regarding the development and implementation of a trusted insider program.

<li><a href="#">Cyber security personnel have access to sufficient data sources and tools to ensure that systems can be monitored for key indicators of compromise.

<li><a href="#">A cyber security incident register is maintained that covers the following: • the date the cyber security incident occurred • the date the cyber security incident was discovered • a description of the cyber security incident • any actions taken in response to the cyber security incident • to whom the cyber security incident was reported.

<li><a href="#">When a data spill occurs, data owners are advised and access to the data is restricted.

<li><a href="#">When malicious code is detected, the following steps are taken to handle the infection: • the infected systems are isolated • all previously connected media used in the period leading up to the infection are scanned for signs of infection and isolated if necessary • antivirus software is used to remove the infection from infected systems and media • if the infection cannot be reliably removed, systems are restored from a known good backup or rebuilt.

<li><a href="#">Legal advice is sought before allowing intrusion activity to continue on a system for the purpose of collecting further data or evidence.

<li><a href="#">System owners are consulted before allowing intrusion activity to continue on a system for the purpose of collecting further data or evidence.

<li><a href="#">Planning and coordination of intrusion remediation activities are conducted on a separate system to that which has been compromised.

<li><a href="#">To the extent possible, all intrusion remediation activities are conducted in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage.

<li><a href="#">Following intrusion remediation activities, full network traffic is captured for at least seven days and analysed to determine whether the adversary has been successfully removed from the system.

<li><a href="#">The integrity of evidence gathered during an investigation is maintained by investigators: • recording all of their actions • creating checksums for all evidence • copying evidence onto media for archiving • maintaining a proper chain of custody.

<li><a href="#">Cyber security incidents are reported to an organisation's CISO, or one of their delegates, as soon as possible after they occur or are discovered.

<li><a href="#">Service providers report cyber security incidents to their customer's CISO, or one of their delegates, as soon as possible after they occur or are discovered.

<li><a href="#">Service providers and their customers maintain 24/7 contact details for each other, including additional out-of-band contact details for when normal communication channels fail, in order to report cyber security incidents.

<li><a href="#">Cyber security incidents are reported to the ACSC.

<li><a href="#">Components and services relevant to the security of systems are identified and understood.

<li><a href="#">Before obtaining components and services relevant to the security of systems, a review of suppliers and service providers (including their country of origin) is performed to assess the potential increase to systems' security risk profile, including by identifying those that are high risk.

<li><a href="#">Suppliers and service providers identified as high risk are not used.

<li><a href="#">Components and services relevant to the security of systems are chosen from suppliers and service providers that have made a commitment to secure-by-design principles, secure programming practices and maintaining the security of their products.

<li><a href="#">Components and services relevant to the security of systems are chosen from suppliers and service providers that have a strong track record of transparency and maintaining the security of their own systems and cyber supply chains.

<li><a href="#">A shared responsibility model is created, documented and shared between suppliers, service providers and their customers in order to articulate the security responsibilities of each party.

<li><a href="#">A managed service register is maintained and verified on a regular basis.

<li><a href="#">A managed service register contains the following for each managed service: • managed service provider's name • purpose for using the managed service • sensitivity or classification of data involved • point of contact for users of the managed service • point of contact for the managed service provider.

<li><a href="#">An outsourced cloud service register is maintained and verified on a regular basis.

<li><a href="#">Only community or private clouds are used for outsourced SECRET and TOP SECRET cloud services.

<li><a href="#">Outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services undergo a security assessment by an IRAP assessor at least every 24 months.

<li><a href="#">Service providers provide an appropriate level of protection for any data entrusted to them or their services.

<li><a href="#">Security requirements associated with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data entrusted to a service provider are documented in contractual arrangements.

<li><a href="#">The right to verify compliance with security requirements is documented in contractual arrangements.
