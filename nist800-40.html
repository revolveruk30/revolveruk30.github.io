<b>800-40 - Guide to Enterprise Patch Management Planning</b>
<P>
<li><a href="#">Patch management is the process for identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying patches for products and systems. Patches correct security and functionality problems in software and firmware. From a security perspective, patches are most often of interest because they are mitigating software flaw vulnerabilities; applying patches to eliminate these vulnerabilities significantly reduces the opportunities for exploitation. Also, patches are usually the most effective way to mitigate software flaw vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities, and are often the only fully effective solution.

<li><a href="#">Ideally, an organization would deploy every new patch immediately to minimize the time that systems are vulnerable to the associated software flaws. However, in reality this is simply not possible because organizations have limited resources, which makes it necessary to prioritize which patches should be installed before other patches. Further complicating this is the significant risk of installing patches without first testing them, which could cause serious operational disruptions, potentially even more damaging than the corresponding security impact of not pushing the patches out.

<li><a href="#">Product vendors have responded to this conflict by improving the quality of their patches and bundling patches for their products. This allows an organization to perform testing once and roll out patches once, which is far more efficient than testing and rolling out all the patches separately. It also reduces the need to prioritize patches—the organization just needs to prioritize the bundle instead of separately prioritizing each patch it contains.

<li><a href="#">There is a downside to patch bundling; it lengthens the time from when a vulnerability is discovered discovered to the time a patch for it becomes publicly available. If an attacker discovers the same vulnerability before the patch is released, the attacker may have a longer window of opportunity to exploit the vulnerability because of the intentional delay in releasing the patch.

<li><a href="#">The release of a patch may provide attackers with the information that they need to exploit the corresponding vulnerability (e.g., reverse engineer the vulnerability from the patch), meaning that a newly released patch might need to be applied immediately to avoid compromises. However, if a vulnerability is not being exploited yet, organizations should carefully weigh the security risks of not patching with the operational risks of patching without first performing thorough testing.

<li><a href="#">In some cases it may make more sense to mitigate a vulnerability through an alternative method, at least until patches are fully deployed and operational. An example is changing configuration settings for vulnerable software to temporarily block vulnerable application functionality.

<li><a href="#">Another problem with changing configuration settings is that they often require a state change to the host to take effect, such as restarting an application. Implementing configuration changes may be as disruptive to the operations of a host as installing a patch.

<li><a href="#">A related problem with patch management configuration is that users may override or circumvent patch management processes. If users are able to make changes to their hosts’ software, such as altering settings (e.g., enabling direct updates, disabling patch management software), installing old versions of software, and uninstalling patches, they can undermine the integrity of the patch management process. process.

<li><a href="#">Enterprise patch management is dependent on having a current and complete inventory of the patchable software (applications and operating systems) installed on each host. This inventory should include not only which software currently installed on each host, but also what version of each piece of software is installed. Without this information, the correct patches cannot be identified, acquired, and installed.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should ensure that their enterprise patch management can avoid resource overload situations, such as by sizing the solution to meet expected volumes of requests, and staggering the delivery of patches so that the enterprise patch management system does not try to transfer patches to too many hosts at the same time.

<li><a href="#">What distinguishes enterprise patch management technologies from each other architecturally are the techniques they use to identify missing patches. The three techniques are agent- agent- based, agentless scanning, and passive network monitoring. Organizations should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each technique when selecting enterprise patch management technologies. 

<li><a href="#">An agent-based patch management technology requires an agent to be running on each host to be patched, with one or more servers that manage the patching process and coordinate with the agents. Each agent is responsible for determining what vulnerable software is installed on the host, communicating with the patch management servers, determining what new patches are available for the host, installing those patches, and executing any state changes needed to make the patches take effect.

<li><a href="#">An agentless scanning patch management technology has one or more servers that perform network scanning of each host to be patched and determine what patches each host needs. Generally agentless scanning requires the servers to have administrative privileges on each host, so that they can return more accurate accurate scanning results and so they have the ability to install patches and implement state changes on the hosts (application restarts, OS reboots, etc.). The main advantage of agentless scanning is that it doesn’t require the installation and execution of an agent on each host.

<li><a href="#">Passive network monitoring technologies for patch management monitor local network traffic to identify applications (and in some cases, operating systems) that are in need of patching. These technologies can be effective at identifying hosts that are not being maintained by other patch management solutions (agent- based, agentless scanning). They do not require any privileges on the hosts to be monitored, so they can be used to monitor the patch status of hosts that the organization does not control (unmanaged systems, systems, contractor systems, etc.)

<li><a href="#">One of the primary limitations of agentless scanning is that it omits hosts not on the local network, such as telecommuter laptops and mobile devices. The primary disadvantage of passive network monitoring is that it only works with software where you can identify the version based on its network traffic (assumed to be unencrypted).

<li><a href="#">Organizations should deploy enterprise patch management tools using a phased approach. This allows process and user communication issues to be addressed with a small group before deploying the patch application universally. Manual methods may need to be used for operating systems and applications not supported by automated patching tools, as well as some computers with unusual configurations.
