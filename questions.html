<li><a href="#">Windows operating systems manage running applications through processes and threads, which are fundamental to the execution of code on the CPU. Processes: A process is an instance of a program being executed, containing the program code and its current activity. Each process in Windows is started by the Windows Process Manager and is allocated its own private virtual address space, along with a unique process identifier (PID).
<li><a href="#">Threads are the smallest units of processing that can be scheduled by the operating system. A thread runs within a process and shares the process's resources. Threads enable parallel execution of tasks within a single process. Task Manager and Resource Monitor allow users to view running processes and their resource consumption. Process Explorer provides detailed information about which handles and DLLs processes have opened or loaded.
<li><a href="#">Windows uses a complex memory management system to optimize the use of RAM and ensure that each process has access to the memory it requires. Virtual Memory: In Windows, virtual memory extends the available memory on the system by storing portions of data on disk when RAM is not sufficient. The system uses a file (pagefile.sys) for this purpose. Page Faults: A page fault occurs when a program tries to access data that is not currently in physical memory. The operating system then retrieves the data from the paging file. Memory Pools: Windows categorizes memory into two pools: the Paged Pool, which can be paged in and out of disk, and the Non-Paged Pool, which resides constantly in physical memory.
<li><a href="#">The Windows File System (NTFS) provides a robust platform for data storage, security, and retrieval. NTFS Features: Journaling: NTFS uses journaling to restore the file system to a previous state in case of a failure. Permissions and Encryption: NTFS supports file permissions for security and can encrypt files and folders with Encrypting File System (EFS). Hard Links and Symbolic Links: These features allow for more versatile file management and accessibility.
<li><a href="#">The Windows Registry acts as a database for storing low-level settings for the operating system and installed applications.

Capabilities: Through WMI, administrators can query and set information on desktop systems, applications, networks, and other enterprise components.
<li><a href="#">Network protocols are foundational elements that govern the exchange of information across digital networks. These sets of rules and conventions are essential for enabling communication between different devices, systems, and applications. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between devices on a network. TCP establishes a connection through a process known as the three-way handshake. This involves an exchange of SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge), and ACK (acknowledge) messages between the client and server.
Data Transmission: Once the connection is established, data packets are sent and received in a sequence-controlled manner. TCP segments data into packets, tracks them with sequence numbers, and ensures they are delivered in order.
Error Handling and Flow Control: TCP implements error checking and flow control mechanisms. If packets are lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order, TCP detects these issues and takes corrective action, such as retransmitting data or adjusting the flow rate.
<li><a href="#">Internet Protocol (IP). Overview: IP is a principal protocol in the Internet protocol suite, tasked with delivering packets from the source host to the destination host based solely on the IP addresses in the packet headers. Addressing: IP addresses are unique numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a network, ensuring accurate packet delivery. Fragmentation and Reassembly: IP handles packets that exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network by fragmenting them into smaller units for transmission and then reassembling them at the destination.
<li><a href="#">HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, enabling the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, incorporating encryption with SSL/TLS to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit. Request-Response Model: HTTP operates on a simple request-response model, where a client sends a request message to the server, which then returns a response. Statelessness: HTTP is stateless, meaning it doesn't retain session information. However, cookies can be used to maintain state between connections. Encryption (HTTPS): HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt the data exchanged, safeguarding against eavesdropping and tampering.
<li><a href="#">Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to resolve human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, facilitating the location of computers and services on the internet. Resolution Process: When a user enters a domain name into a browser, DNS servers translate that domain into its corresponding IP address, directing the user's internet connection to the appropriate server. Caching: To reduce DNS query times, DNS records are temporarily stored (cached) at various points of the network, including the user's operating system, DNS resolvers, and browsers.
<li><a href="#">SMTP: Operates primarily to send email messages from a client to a server or between servers.
POP: Downloads emails from a server to a single device, and typically deletes the mail from the server.
IMAP: Allows multiple clients to access email stored on a server, facilitating operations like message flagging, searching, and folder manipulation directly on the server.

Utilizing threat intelligence effectively allows SOCs to stay ahead of attackers by anticipating their moves, closing security gaps, and continuously refining their defense mechanisms against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. 
<li><a href="#"><b>Can you explain the difference between IDS and IPS?</b> 
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) are critical components in network security, serving complementary but distinct roles. An IDS monitors network and system traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats, generating alerts when such activities are detected. It 
Conversely, an IPS not only detects threats but also takes preemptive measures to block or mitigate those threats before they can inflict damage. Positioned inline, an IPS actively controls the data flow based on its analysis, effectively serving as a gatekeeper that enforces security policies by preventing identified threats from penetrating the network. Together, IDS and IPS form a robust defense mechanism, offering both awareness and proactive protection against malicious activities. 
<li><a href="#"><b>Can you explain the difference between true positive, false positive, and false negative?</b> 
In the context of cybersecurity and threat detection, understanding the distinctions between true positive, false positive, and false negative is crucial for effective security operations. A true positive occurs when a security system correctly identifies an actual threat, 
validating the effectiveness of the security measures in place. Conversely, a false positive arises when the system inaccurately flags benign activity as malicious, 
leading to unnecessary alerts and potentially diverting resources from real threats. A false negative represents a significant risk, as it occurs when a security system fails to detect an actual threat, 
allowing malicious activities to proceed undetected and unmitigated. Effectively managing the balance between these outcomes is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring robust security defenses. 
<li><a href="#"><b>Can You Explain What a Brute Force Attack Is?</b> 
A brute force attack is a cybersecurity threat where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system by systematically checking all possible passwords or passphrases until the correct one is found. 
This method relies on the sheer computational 
power and time, rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities or using more sophisticated hacking techniques. It's a trial-and-error approach targeting weak password policies or encryption keys. To defend against brute force attacks, it is imperative to enforce strong, complex passwords, implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed attempts, and utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA). These measures significantly increase the difficulty for attackers, effectively reducing the risk of unauthorized access through brute force methods. 
<li><a href="#"><b>Can you give examples of common security vulnerabilities?</b>

<li><a href="#"><b>What is three-way handshake?</b> 
The three-way handshake is a fundamental process used in TCP/IP networks to establish a reliable connection between a client and server. It involves three sequential steps: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK. Initially, the client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, indicating its intention to initiate a communication session. Upon receiving this SYN packet, the server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, acknowledging the receipt of the SYN packet and simultaneously indicating its readiness to establish a connection. Finally, the client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, confirming the receipt of the SYN-ACK packet and completing the handshake. This process ensures that both the client and server have agreed upon the parameters of the network communication, setting the stage for a secure and reliable data exchange. The three-way handshake is critical for establishing connections in a manner that minimizes the risk of data loss or corruption, embodying the principles of reliability and efficiency in network communications. 
<li><a href="#"><b>What is your approach to identifying and mitigating insider threats?</b> 
Identifying and mitigating insider threats requires a comprehensive, multi-layered strategy centered on continuous monitoring, strict access controls, and an informed organizational culture. Begin by implementing robust user activity monitoring systems to detect unusual behavior patterns or unauthorized access attempts, ensuring that you can quickly identify potential threats from within. Employ the principle of least privilege, granting employees 
access only to the information necessary for their roles, thereby minimizing opportunities for internal misuse. Regularly update these access privileges in response to changes in roles or employment status. Educate your workforce about the signs of insider threats and the importance of security practices through ongoing training sessions, creating a vigilant and security-aware culture. Additionally, establish clear policies and procedures for responding to insider threats, including incident reporting mechanisms and disciplinary actions, to ensure swift and decisive action can be taken to mitigate any identified risks. This proactive and informed approach is essential for safeguarding your organization's assets against the complex challenge of insider threats. 
<li><a href="#"><b>What is your greatest strength and weakness?</b> 
When addressing the question of your greatest strength and weakness during a job interview, it's pivotal to strike a balance between authenticity and strategic positioning. For your strength, select a quality that is directly relevant to the role you're applying for, providing a concrete example that demonstrates how this strength has contributed to your professional achievements. This showcases your self-awareness and the tangible value you bring to the team. When discussing your weakness, choose an area you have actively worked on improving, highlighting the specific steps you've taken to mitigate this vulnerability. This approach not only displays honesty but also illustrates your commitment to personal and professional growth. Remember, the key is to be genuine and reflective, ensuring your answers align with the job requirements while presenting yourself as a resilient and adaptable candidate. 
<li><a href="#"><b>What is your ideal working environment?</b> 
When responding to the question about your ideal working environment in a job interview, it is essential to articulate a clear and well-considered answer that aligns with both your professional needs and the characteristics of the company. Begin by describing specific elements that enable you to thrive, such as a collaborative team dynamic, opportunities for growth and learning, or a culture that values innovation and creativity. Ensure your response reflects an understanding of the company’s own environment, indicating that you have researched and are genuinely interested in becoming part of their team. It's critical to communicate flexibility and adaptability, showing that while you have preferences, you are capable of excelling in various settings. This approach demonstrates not only your awareness of the conditions under which you perform best but also your readiness to integrate into the company’s culture, making you a compelling candidate. 
<li><a href="#"><b>What’s an acceptable level of risk?</b> 
An acceptable level of risk, often referred to as risk tolerance, is the degree of uncertainty an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives, before action is deemed necessary to reduce the risk. This threshold varies significantly between organizations, depending on their specific operational context, regulatory requirements, and strategic goals. Determining an acceptable level of risk involves a careful analysis of potential threats against the value of the assets at risk, balanced by the cost and feasibility of implementing mitigations. It requires input from all levels of management and should be aligned with the organization's overall risk management strategy. Establishing clear criteria for acceptable risk is crucial for informed decision-making, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that the organization's operations and reputation are protected without stifling innovation or growth. 
<li><a href="#"><b>Which field of which event should I look at so that I can detect RDP logons?</b> 
To effectively detect Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logons within a network, focus on scrutinizing the Event Viewer in Windows systems. Specifically, direct your attention to the Security logs under the Windows Logs section. Here, the events to monitor are those with Event ID 4624 (an account was successfully logged on) and Event ID 4778 (a session was reconnected to a Window Station). These IDs signify successful logon attempts and session reconnections, respectively, which are critical indicators of RDP activity. Additionally, ensure to examine the Logon Type field within these events; a Logon Type value of 10 indicates a remote interactive logon, which is commonly associated with RDP access. By meticulously monitoring these fields, you can reliably track and analyze RDP logon activities, thereby bolstering your network's security posture against unauthorized access. 
<li><a href="#"><b>Why is Chain of Custody important?</b> 
Chain of custody is imperative in ensuring the integrity and admissibility of evidence, whether in legal proceedings, forensic investigations, or compliance audits. It provides a documented and unbroken trail that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of materials, physical or electronic. This meticulous documentation process is crucial for establishing the authenticity and reliability of evidence, safeguarding it against tampering, alteration, or loss. By maintaining a clear and comprehensive chain of custody, organizations and legal entities uphold the principles of accountability and transparency, ensuring that evidence is handled in a consistent and standardized manner. Consequently, the chain of custody not only reinforces the credibility of the evidence presented but also supports the integrity of the investigative or judicial process, making it a foundational aspect of trustworthy and effective evidence management.
