<b>800-83 - Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#">Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a program that is covertly inserted into another program with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system. Malware is the most common external threat to most hosts, causing widespread damage and disruption and necessitating extensive recovery efforts within most organizations. 

<li><a href="#">The following are the classic categories of malware:

<li><a href="#">• Viruses. A virus self-replicates by inserting copies of itself into host programs or data files. Viruses are often triggered through user interaction, such as opening a file or running a program. Viruses can be divided into the following two subcategories: 

<li><a href="#">Compiled Viruses. A compiled virus is executed by an operating system. Types of compiled viruses include file infector viruses, which attach themselves to executable programs; boot sector viruses, which infect the master boot records of hard drives or the boot sectors of removable media; and multipartite viruses, which combine the characteristics of file infector and boot sector viruses.

<li><a href="#">Interpreted Viruses. Interpreted viruses are executed by an application. Within this subcategory, macro viruses take advantage of the capabilities of applications’ macro programming language to infect application documents and document templates, while scripting viruses infect scripts that are understood by scripting languages processed by services on the OS. 

<li><a href="#">• Worms. A worm is a self-replicating, self-contained program that usually executes itself without user intervention. Worms are divided into two categories: 

<li><a href="#">Network Service Worms. A network service worm takes advantage of a vulnerability in a network service to propagate itself and infect other hosts.

<li><a href="#">Mass Mailing Worms. A mass mailing worm is similar to an email-borne virus but is self-contained, rather than infecting an existing file.

<li><a href="#">• Trojan Horses. A Trojan horse is a self-contained, nonreplicating program that, while appearing to be benign, actually has a hidden malicious purpose. Trojan horses either replace existing files with malicious versions or add new malicious files to hosts.

<li><a href="#">•Malicious Mobile Code. Malicious mobile code is software with malicious intent that is transmitted from a remote host to a local host and then executed on the local host, typically without the user’s explicit instruction. Popular languages for malicious mobile code include Java, ActiveX, JavaScript, and VBScript. 

<li><a href="#">Many, if not most, instances of malware today are blended attacks. Current malware also relies heavily on social engineering, which is a general term for attackers trying to trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions, such as downloading and executing files that appear to be benign but are actually malicious.

<li><a href="#">In the growing trend of web-based malware, also known as drive-by-download, a user’s web browsing is redirected to an infected website, often with little or no use of social engineering techniques. The infected website then attempts to exploit vulnerabilities on the user’s host and ultimately to install rootkits or other attacker tools onto the host.

<li><a href="#">Popular types of attacker tools are as follows:

<li><a href="#">• A backdoor is a malicious program that listens for commands on a certain TCP or UDP port. Most backdoors allow an attacker to perform a certain set of actions on a host, such as acquiring passwords or executing arbitrary commands.

<li><a href="#">• A keystroke logger monitors and records keyboard use. Some require the attacker to retrieve the data from the host, whereas other loggers actively transfer the data to another host through email, file transfer, or other means.

<li><a href="#">• A rootkit is a collection of files that is installed on a host to alter its standard functionality in a malicious and stealthy way. A rootkit typically makes many changes to a host to hide the rootkit’s existence, making it very difficult to determine that the rootkit is present and to identify what the rootkit has changed.

<li><a href="#">• A web browser plug-in provides a way for certain types of content to be displayed or executed through a web browser. Malicious web browser plug-ins can monitor all use of a browser. 

<li><a href="#">The characteristic of today’s malware that most distinguishes it from previous generations of malware is its degree of customization. It has become trivial for attackers to create their own malware by acquiring malware toolkits, such as Zeus, SpyEye, and Poison Ivy, and customizing the malware produced by those toolkits to meet their individual needs.

<li><a href="#">Malware customization causes significant problems for malware detection, because it greatly increases the variety of malware that antivirus software and other security controls need to detect and block. When attackers are capable of sending a unique attack to each potential victim, it should not be surprising that largely signature-based security controls, such as antivirus software, cannot keep up with them.

<li><a href="#">Another important characteristic of today’s malware is its stealthy nature. Unlike most malware several years ago, which tended to be easy to notice, much of today’s malware is specifically designed to quietly, slowly spread to other hosts, gathering information over extended periods of time and eventually leading to exfiltration of sensitive data. The term advanced persistent threats (APTs) is generally used to refer to such types of malware.

<li><a href="#">The main elements of prevention are policy, awareness, vulnerability mitigation, threat mitigation, and defensive architecture. When planning an approach to malware prevention, organizations should be mindful of the attack vectors that are most likely to be used currently and in the near future.

<li><a href="#">However, organizations should be aware that no matter how much effort they put into malware incident prevention, incidents will still occur (e. g., previously unknown types of threats, human error). For this reason, organizations should have robust malware incident handling capabilities to limit the damage that malware can cause and restore data and services efficiently.

<li><a href="#">If an organization does not state malware prevention considerations clearly in its policies, it is unlikely to perform malware prevention activities consistently and effectively throughout the organization. Malware prevention– related policy should be as general as possible to provide flexibility in policy implementation and to reduce the need for frequent policy updates, but also specific enough to make the intent and scope of the policy clear.

<li><a href="#">Common malware prevention–related policy considerations include the following:

<li><a href="#">• Requiring the scanning of media from outside of the organization for malware before they can be used 
<li><a href="#">• Requiring that email file attachments be scanned before they are opened 
<li><a href="#">• Prohibiting the sending or receipt of certain types of files (e.g., .exe files) via email
<li><a href="#">• Restricting or prohibiting the use of unnecessary software.
<li><a href="#">• Restricting the use of removable media (e.g., flash drives).
<li><a href="#">• Specifying which types of preventive software are required for each type of host and application and listing the high-level requirements for configuring and maintaining the software
<li><a href="#">• Restricting or prohibiting the use of organization-issued and/or personally-owned mobile devices on the organization’s networks

<li><a href="#">All users should be made aware of the ways in which malware enters and infects hosts; the risks that malware poses; the inability of technical controls to prevent all incidents; and the importance of users in preventing incidents, with an emphasis on avoiding social engineering attacks. Examples of such practices are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Not opening suspicious emails or email attachments, clicking on hyperlinks.
<li><a href="#">• Not clicking on suspicious web browser popup windows
<li><a href="#">• Not disabling malware security control mechanisms
<li><a href="#">• Not using administrator-level accounts for regular host operation
<li><a href="#">• Not downloading or executing applications from untrusted sources.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should also make users aware of policies and procedures that apply to malware incident handling, such as how to identify if a host may be infected, how to report a suspected incident, and what users might need to do to assist with incident handling.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should educate their users on the social engineering techniques that are employed to trick users into disclosing information. Examples of recommendations for avoiding phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering include:

<li><a href="#">• Never reply to email requests for financial or personal information. Instead, contact the person or the organization at the legitimate phone number or website.
<li><a href="#">• Do not provide passwords, PINs, or other access codes in response to emails or unsolicited popup windows.
<li><a href="#">• Do not open suspicious email file attachments, even if they come from known senders.
<li><a href="#">• Do not respond to any suspicious or unwanted emails.

<li><a href="#">An organization should not rely on user awareness as its primary method of preventing malware incidents; instead, the awareness program should supplement the technical controls to provide additional protection against incidents. 

<li><a href="#">On an ongoing basis, some IT staff members (most likely, members of the security or incident response teams) should receive and review bulletins on types of new malware threats, assess the likely risk to the organization, and inform the necessary IT staff members of the new threat so that incidents can be prevented.

<li><a href="#">Malware often attacks hosts by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems, services, and applications. Consequently, mitigating vulnerabilities is very important to the prevention of malware incidents.

<li><a href="#">A vulnerability can usually be mitigated by one or more methods, such as applying patches to update the software or reconfiguring the software (e.g., a vulnerable service).

<li><a href="#">Organizations should consider using security automation technologies with OS and application configuration checklists to help administrators secure hosts consistently and effectively. Security automation technologies can use checklists to apply configuration settings that improve the default level of security and to continuously monitor the hosts’ settings to verify that they are still in compliance with the checklist settings.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should also consider using security automation technologies for OS and application patch management— to identify, acquire, distribute, and install security-related patches so as to mitigate vulnerabilities that the patches address.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should implement host hardening measures that can further reduce the possibility of malware incidents, such as the following:

<li><a href="#">• Disabling or removing unneeded services (particularly network services).
<li><a href="#">• Eliminating unsecured file shares, which are a common way for malware to spread
<li><a href="#">• Removing or changing default usernames and passwords for OSs and applications.
<li><a href="#">• Disabling automatic execution of binaries and scripts, including AutoRun
<li><a href="#">• Changing the default file associations for file types that are most frequently used by malware so that such files are not run automatically if users attempt to open them. 

<li><a href="#">Host hardening should also include applications, such as email clients, web browsers, and word processors, that are frequently targeted by malware. Organizations should disable unneeded features and capabilities from these applications, particularly those that are commonly exploited by malware, to limit the possible attack vectors for malware.

<li><a href="#">Antivirus software is the most commonly used technical control for malware threat mitigation. There are many brands of antivirus software, with most providing similar protection through the following recommended capabilities: 

<li><a href="#">• Scanning critical host components such as startup files and boot records. 
<li><a href="#">• Watching real-time activities on hosts to check for suspicious activity;
<li><a href="#">Antivirus software should be configured to perform real-time scans of each file as it is downloaded, opened, or executed, which is known as on-access scanning.
<li><a href="#">• Monitoring the behavior of common applications, such as email clients, web browsers, and instant messaging software. Antivirus software should monitor activity involving the applications most likely to be used to infect hosts or spread malware to other hosts. 
<li><a href="#">• Scanning files for known malware. Antivirus software on hosts should be configured to scan all hard drives regularly to identify any file system infections. Users should also be able to launch a scan manually as needed, which is known as on-demand scanning.
<li><a href="#">• Disinfecting files, which refers to removing malware from within a file, and quarantining files, which means that files containing malware are stored in isolation for future disinfection or examination.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should use both host-based and network-based antivirus scanning. The antivirus software should be configured and maintained properly so that it continues to be effective at detecting and stopping malware. Antivirus software is most effective when its signatures are fully up-to-date. Accordingly, antivirus software should be kept current with the latest signature and software updates.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should use centrally managed antivirus software that is controlled and monitored regularly by antivirus administrators, who are also typically responsible for acquiring, testing, approving, and delivering antivirus signature and software updates throughout the organization.

<li><a href="#">A possible measure for improving malware prevention is to use multiple antivirus products for key hosts, such as email servers. For example, one antivirus product could be used on perimeter email servers and another on internal email servers. This could provide more effective detection of new threats, but also would necessitate increased administration and training.

<li><a href="#">Network-based intrusion prevention systems (IPS) perform packet sniffing and analyze network traffic to identify and stop suspicious activity. Network-based IPS products are typically deployed inline, which means that the software acts like a network firewall. It receives packets, analyzes them, and allows acceptable packets to pass through.

<li><a href="#">Some IPS are highly customizable, allowing administrators to create and deploy attack signatures for many major new malware threats in a matter of minutes. Although there are risks in doing this, such as a poorly written signature triggering false positives block benign activity inadvertently, a custom signature can block a new malware threat hours before antivirus signatures become available.

<li><a href="#">Another form of IPS, known as a network behavior analysis (NBA) system, attempts to stop attacks by identifying unusual network traffic flows. Although these products are primarily intended to stop distributed denial of service ( DDoS) attacks against an organization, they can also be used to identify worm activity and other forms of malware, as well as use of attacker tools such as backdoors.

<li><a href="#">Host-based IPS products are similar in principle and purpose to other IPSs, except that a host-based IPS product monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host. Examples of activity that might be monitored by host-based IPSs include host logs, running processes, file access and modification, and host and application configuration changes.

<li><a href="#">A network firewall is a device deployed between networks to restrict which types of traffic can pass from one network to another. A host-based firewall is a piece of software running on a single host that can restrict incoming and outgoing network activity for that host only. Both types of firewalls can be useful for preventing malware incidents. Organizations should configure their firewalls with deny by default rulesets, meaning that the firewalls deny all incoming traffic that is not expressly permitted.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should use spam filtering technologies to reduce the amount of spam that reaches users. Spam is often used for malware delivery, particularly phishing attacks, so reducing spam should lead to a corresponding decline in spam-triggered malware incidents. Organizations should also consider configuring their email servers and clients to block attachments with file extensions that are associated with malicious code (e.g., .pif, .vbs), and suspicious file extension combinations (e.g., .txt.vbs, .htm.exe).

<li><a href="#">Both email and web content filtering should use real-time blacklists, reputation services, and other similar mechanisms whenever feasible to avoid accepting from known or likely malicious hosts and domains.

<li><a href="#">Real-time blacklists tend to be based on observed malware activity, while reputation services may be based on user opinions or on automated analysis of websites, emails, etc. without necessarily detecting malware.

<li><a href="#">Most application whitelisting technologies can be run in two modes: audit and enforcement. In enforcement mode, the technology generally prohibits all applications that are not in the whitelist from being executed. In audit mode, the technology logs all instances of non-whitelisted applications being run on the host, but does not act to stop them.

<li><a href="#">Organizations deploying application whitelisting technologies should consider first deploying them in audit mode, so as to identify any necessary applications missing from the whitelist, before reconfiguring them for enforcement mode.

<li><a href="#">Sandboxing refers to a security model where applications are run within a sandbox— a controlled environment that restricts what operations the applications can perform and that isolates them from other applications running on the same host. Another benefit of sandboxing is that the sandbox itself can be reset to a known good state every time it is initialized. 

<li><a href="#">Users can use one brand of browser for corporate applications and another brand of browser for all other access. This separates the sensitive corporate data within one browser from the data within the other browser, providing better protection for the corporate data and reducing the likelihood that malware encountered during general web browsing will affect corporate applications.

<li><a href="#">Having a separate brand of browser for corporate applications also allows that browser to be secured more tightly, such as disabling all forms of mobile code (e.g., Java, ActiveX) that are not required for the specified applications.

<li><a href="#">Virtualization can be used to segregate applications or operating systems from each other, with much more rigor than simple browser separation can provide. For example, an organization could have one OS instance for corporate applications and another OS instance for all other activities, including web browsing. Another benefit is that every time an image is restarted, it can be reloaded from the known-good image, ensuring that any compromises occurring within the image are eradicated. 

<li><a href="#">All malware incident handlers should have a solid understanding of how each major category of malware infects hosts and spreads. Also, incident handlers should be familiar with the organization’s implementations and configurations of malware detection tools so that they are better able to analyze supporting data and identify the characteristics of threats.

<li><a href="#">To improve communication and coordination, an organization should designate in advance a few individuals or a small team to be responsible for coordinating the organization’s responses to malware incidents. The coordinator’s primary goal is to maintain situational awareness by gathering all pertinent information and communicating information and decisions to all relevant parties in a timely manner.

<li><a href="#">Because no indicator is completely reliable— even antivirus software might miscategorize benign activity as malicious— incident handlers need to analyze any suspected malware incident and validate that malware is the cause. If the source of the incident cannot easily be confirmed, it is often better to respond as if it were caused by malware and to alter response efforts it is later determined that malware is not involved.

<li><a href="#">Incident handlers should collaborate with security administrators in advance to identify data sources that can aid in detecting malware information and to understand what types of information each data source may record.

<li><a href="#">Once incident handlers have reviewed detection source data and identified characteristics of the malware, the handlers could search for those characteristics in antivirus vendors’ malware databases and identify which instance of malware is the most likely cause.

<li><a href="#">Unfortunately, the newest threats might not be included in malware databases for several hours or days, depending on the relative importance of the threat, and highly customized threats might not be included in malware databases at all. Therefore, incident handlers may need to consult other sources of information.

<li><a href="#">Given the number of malware threats, all infection identification should be performed through automated means. Manual identification methods, such as relying on users to identify and report infected hosts, and having technical staff personally check each host, are not feasible for most situations.

<li><a href="#">The most obvious sources of evidence are those that are designed to identify malware activity, such as antivirus software, content filtering (e.g., anti-spam measures), IPS, and SIEM technologies.

<li><a href="#">In situations in which the typical sources of evidence do not contain the necessary information, organizations might need to turn to secondary sources, such as the following:

<li><a href="#">• DNS server logs often contain records of infected hosts attempting to get the IP address for an external malicious site that they are trying to interact with (e.g., send data to, receive commands from). Analysts should be cautious of blocking hosts based only on resolved IP addresses because many current attacks use fast flux DNS, which means that each domain resolves to several different IP addresses.

<li><a href="#">• Other Application Server Logs. Applications commonly used as malware transmission mechanisms, such as email and HTTP, might record information in their logs that indicates which hosts were infected.

<li><a href="#">• Network Forensic Tools. Software programs that capture and record packets, such as network forensic analysis tools and packet sniffers, might have highly detailed information on malware activity.

<li><a href="#">• Network Device Logs. Firewalls, routers, and other filtering devices that record connection activity, as well as network monitoring tools, might be helpful in identifying network connection activity (e.g., specific port number combinations, unusual protocols) consistent with certain malware.

<li><a href="#">Active identification can be performed through several methods, including the following:

<li><a href="#">• Security automation technologies, particularly those used for continuous monitoring (e.g., network access control technologies), can be used to check host characteristics for signs of a current infection, such as a particular configuration setting or a system file with a certain size that indicates an infection. Security automation technologies are generally the preferred method for active identification.

<li><a href="#">• Custom Network-Based IPS or IDS Signature. Writing a custom IPS or IDS signature that identifies infected hosts is often a highly effective technique. Some organizations have separate IPS or IDS sensors with strong signature-writing capabilities that can be dedicated to identifying malware infections. This provides a high-quality source of information while keeping other sensors from becoming overloaded with malware alerts. 

<li><a href="#">• Packet Sniffers and Protocol Analyzers. Configuring packet sniffers and protocol analyzers to look only for network traffic matching the characteristics of a particular malware threat can be effective at identifying infected hosts.

<li><a href="#">Another method for identifying infected hosts is the manual approach. This is by far the most labor-intensive of the three methods. It should only be considered in those situations where automated methods are not feasible, such as when networks are completely by infection-related traffic using spoofed addresses. In many cases, it is most effective to use multiple approaches simultaneously or in sequence to provide the best results.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should establish a set of criteria that identify the appropriate level of response for various malware-related situations. The criteria should incorporate considerations such as the following: 

<li><a href="#">• How the malware entered the environment and what transmission mechanisms it uses 
<li><a href="#">• What type of malware it is (e.g., virus, worm, Trojan horse) 
<li><a href="#">• Which types of attacker tools are placed onto the host by the malware
<li><a href="#">• What networks and hosts the malware is affecting and how it is affecting them
<li><a href="#">• How the impact of the incident is likely to increase if the incident is not contained.

<li><a href="#">Incident handlers can study the behavior of malware by analyzing it either actively (executing the malware) or forensically (examining the infected host for evidence of malware). Forensic approaches are safer to perform on an infected host because they can examine the host without allowing the malware to continue executing. However, sometimes it is significantly faster and easier to analyze malware by monitoring it during execution. Such active approaches are best performed on malware test systems instead of production hosts, to minimize possible damage caused by allowing the malware to execute. 

<li><a href="#">There are two basic forensic approaches: create a bootable forensic environment on write-protected removable media, or use a forensic workstation and connect it to the storage of the infected host (e.g., hard drive).

<li><a href="#">Containment of malware has two major components: stopping the spread of the malware and preventing further damage to hosts. Nearly every malware incident requires containment actions.

<li><a href="#">Containment of isolated incidents and incidents involving forms of malware is generally straightforward, involving such actions as disconnecting the affected hosts from networks or shutting down the hosts.

<li><a href="#">Handlers should not assume that just because a host has been disconnected from the network, further damage to the host has been prevented, and in many cases, should begin eradication efforts as soon as possible to prevent more damage. 

<li><a href="#">Containment methods can be divided into four basic categories: relying on user participation, performing automated detection, temporarily halting services, and blocking certain types of network connectivity.

<li><a href="#">As hosts have increasingly become managed, user participation in containment has sharply decreased. However, having users perform containment actions is still helpful in non-managed environments and other situations in which use of fully automated containment methods is not feasible.

<li><a href="#">For large-scale incidents involving a sizable percentage of the organization’s hosts in non-managed environments, user involvement in containment can significantly reduce the burden on incident handlers and technical support staff in responding to the incident. 

<li><a href="#">Organizations should be prepared to use other security tools to contain the malware until the antivirus signatures can perform the containment effectively, if antivirus signatures become available at all.

<li><a href="#">Examples of automated detection methods other than antivirus software are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Content Filtering. For example, email servers and clients, as well as anti-spam software, can be configured to block emails or email attachments that have certain characteristics, such as a known bad subject, sender, message text, or attachment name or type.

<li><a href="#">• Network-Based IPS Software. If a network-based IPS device is inline, meaning that it is an active part of the network, and it has a signature for the malware, it should be able to identify the malware and stop it from reaching its targets.

<li><a href="#">• Executable Blacklisting. If antivirus signatures are not yet available for a new threat, it might be possible to configure a blacklisting technology to block the execution of the files are part of the new threat.

<li><a href="#">Some malware incidents necessitate more drastic and potentially disruptive measures for containment. These incidents make extensive use of a particular service. Containing such an incident quickly and effectively might be accomplished through a loss of services, such as shutting down a service used by malware, blocking a certain service at the network perimeter, or disabling portions of a service (e.g., large mailing lists).

<li><a href="#">This action is typically performed at the application level (e.g., disabling a service on servers) or at the network level (e.g., configuring firewalls to block IP addresses or ports associated with a service). The goal is to disable as little functionality as possible while containing the incident effectively. To support the disabling of network services, organizations should maintain lists of the services they use and the TCP and UDP ports used by each service. 

<li><a href="#">Organizations should maintain a list of dependencies between major services so that incident handlers are aware of them when making containment decisions. Also, organizations might find it helpful to provide alternative services with similar functionality. The same strategy could be used for cases involving exploitation of vulnerabilities in web browsers and other common client applications.

<li><a href="#">In worst-case scenarios, isolating subnets from the primary network or the Internet might be necessary to stop the spread of malware, halt damage to hosts, and provide an opportunity to mitigate vulnerabilities.

<li><a href="#">Organizations can design and implement their networks to make containment through loss of connectivity easier to do and less disruptive. For example, some organizations place their servers and workstations on separate subnets; during a malware incident targeting workstations, the infected workstation subnets can be isolated from the main network, and the server subnets can continue to provide functionality.

<li><a href="#">Another network design strategy related to malware containment is the use of separate virtual local area networks (VLAN) for infected hosts. When the host attempts to connect to the network, a network device such as a router requests information from the host’s agent. If the host does not respond to the request or the response indicates that the host is insecure, the network device causes the host to be placed onto a separate VLAN.

<li><a href="#">Although the primary goal of eradication is to remove malware from infected hosts, eradication is typically more involved than that. If an infection was successful because of a host vulnerability or other security weakness, such as an unsecured file share, then eradication includes the elimination or mitigation of that weakness.

<li><a href="#">For many malware incidents, simple disinfection is not feasible, so it is necessary to rebuild all infected hosts as part of eradication efforts. Rebuilding includes the reinstallation and securing of the OS and applications (or restoration of known good OS and application backups, including the use of built-in OS rollback capabilities), and the restoration of data from known good backups.

<li><a href="#">Also, in some cases it is faster to rebuild a host than to perform all of the analysis necessary to determine exactly what the malware has done and remove all traces of it from the host. This is particularly true in managed environments where hosts are built based on standard OS images, baselines.

<li><a href="#">In general, organizations should rebuild any host that has any of the following incident characteristics, instead of performing typical eradication actions (disinfection):

<li><a href="#">• One or more attackers gained administrator-level access to the host.
<li><a href="#">• System files were replaced by a Trojan horse, backdoor, rootkit, attacker tools, or other means. 
<li><a href="#">• The host is unstable or does not function properly after the malware has been eradicated
<li><a href="#">• There is doubt about the nature of and extent of the infection or any unauthorized access gained because of the infection.

<li><a href="#">The two main aspects of recovery from malware incidents are restoring the functionality and data of infected hosts and removing temporary containment measures.

<li><a href="#">Incident response teams should strive to keep containment measures in place until the estimated number of infected hosts and hosts vulnerable to infection is sufficiently low that subsequent incidents should be of little consequence.

<li><a href="#">It is particularly important for organizations to conduct robust lessons learned activities for major malware incidents. Although it is reasonable to give handlers and other key people a few days to catch up on other tasks, review meetings and other efforts should occur expeditiously, while the incident is still fresh in everyone’s minds.

<li><a href="#">Examples of possible outcomes of lessons learned activities for malware incidents are as follows: 

<li><a href="#">• Security policies might be modified to prevent similar incidents. For example, if connecting personally owned mobile devices to organization laptops caused a serious infection, modifying the organization’s policies to secure, restrict, or prohibit such device connections might be advisable.

<li><a href="#">• Security awareness training for users might be changed to reduce the number of infections or to improve users’ actions in reporting incidents and assisting with handling incidents on their own hosts.

<li><a href="#">• Software Reconfiguration. OS or application settings might need to be changed to support security policy changes or to achieve compliance with existing policy. 

<li><a href="#">• Malware Detection Software Deployment. An incident might provide sufficient justification to purchase and deploy additional software.

<li><a href="#">• Malware Detection Software Reconfiguration. Detection software might need to be reconfigured in various ways.
