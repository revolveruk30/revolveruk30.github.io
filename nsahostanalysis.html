<b>NSA - Host Analysis Methodology</b>
<P>


<li><a href="#">It is critical throughout the entire process to document every step. It is important to have consistent and accurate records of every action taken, as well as the information resulting from these actions.

<li><a href="#">Good documentation ensures that anyone unfamiliar with the assessment can easily understand everything that was assessed and quickly locate findings.
<li><a href="#">Before starting an assessment, the scope of the assessment must be considered. A clearly defined scope informs every action, keeps focus on the objectives, and prevents the project from moving outside of the bounds of the assessment.

<li><a href="#">While an incident response consists of searching for and analyzing malicious behavior, an assessment’s main goal is to create a better understanding of the network and the devices on it. Evidence of malicious activity should be documented and passed on to the appropriate individuals. Surveyors must not focus on tracking down malicious activity at the expense of the larger project; the goal is to conduct an assessment of the network.

<li><a href="#">Scope should also ensure that resources are used efficiently. It is easy during the course of analysis to get off track and pursue leads that add no value to the assessment.

<li><a href="#">Changes to live systems should always be avoided. Obtaining network information, such as packet captures and scans, must be passive in nature. Never modify or delete files or software on a system, even malicious software or bloatware. It is not within the scope of an assessment to fix these issues; instead, the software should be documented and the system owner should be notified.

<li><a href="#">Network analysis should always be conducted on static packet captures. Host-based analysis should always be conducted on an image of the host whenever possible.

<li><a href="#">It is important to start learning the network before an on-site assessment begins. This will ensure that the surveyor can identify critical areas and potential problems that may be encountered and can have a plan to address them ahead of time.

<li><a href="#">The contacts should be able to provide a list of all relevant hardware. Examples of the hardware that should be contained in this list include the following:
<br> • Workstations
<br> • Servers
<br> • Control devices
<br> • Printers
<br> • Routers
<br> • Mobile devices
<br> • Wireless access points

<li><a href="#">An ideal software list includes information relating to software that is important to the functioning of individual devices or the network as a whole. Types of software that should be included in the list are:
<br> • Remote access software
<br> • Virtual Private Network (VPN) software
<br> • Firewalls
<br> • Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
<br> • Control System software
<br> • Operating Systems
<br> • Web server software
<br> • Email software 

<li><a href="#">An IP address list should contain the following information for every networked device: 
<br> • IP address 
<br> • Device name 
<br> • Host name
<br> • MAC address
<br> • Physical location
<br> • Operating System

<li><a href="#">Documentation on the network topology should include:
<br> • Every sub-network
<br> • Function of each sub-network
<br> • IP address of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server
<br> • IP address of Gateway router for every sub-network
<br> • IP address of Domain Name System (DNS) server

<li><a href="#">Many systems will utilize the services of third-party vendors, and surveyors should be aware of the impact vendors can have on the system. The surveyor should make inquiries regarding vendor details, such as:
<br> • User accounts and permissions
<br> • Whether they have remote access;
<br> • How do they perform maintenance and updates

<li><a href="#">Due to the critical nature of control systems, back-ups are an integral part of the network. Inquire about what systems are backed up, how often they are backed up, the process used, and how often they are tested.

<li><a href="#">An important aspect of an assessment is identifying critical systems. A critical system is a system that, if inoperable, will cause grave disruption to normal network operations. The surveyor’s surveyor’s contacts may be able to provide input into what systems should be considered critical.

<li><a href="#">Host-based analysis on potential critical systems should be compared with the findings of network analysis on those same systems, as this gives a more complete picture of the function of that device. Network traffic from a device may be able to be tied to a particular program installed on that machine.

<li><a href="#">The information gained from network analysis will directly impact host analysis. The results of network traffic will likely identify the critical systems on which to conduct host-based analysis. Since most networks potentially contain hundreds of devices, host- based analysis on every device in a short time frame is unfeasible, so the surveyor must focus on those systems that are most critical to the operation of the network.

<li><a href="#">There are numerous pieces of information that should be documented from network analysis and utilized in host-based analysis. This list includes but is not limited to: 
<br> • MAC Addresses 
<br> • IP Addresses 
<br> • Open Ports 
<br> • Network services and protocols active 
<br> • Operating system and software versions 
<br> • Connections to other devices 
<br> • Credentials passed to or from the system

<li><a href="#">System owners as well as administrators should know what programs, services, or processes execute when systems are accessed by users. This information can be useful for troubleshooting, forensic analysis, and configuration of security features such as firewalls, anti-virus, and whitelisting.

<li><a href="#">Some of the steps in the host-based analysis process can easily break a control system. Thus, the surveyor should always use a virtual image whenever possible. This will enable the surveyor to run more commands without the possibility of disrupting the actual system.

<li><a href="#">systeminfo -- System information displays a summary of the computer’s computer’s hardware/software configuration, computer components, and operating-environment parameters. This allows users quick access to system configurations for software installations, software updates, and troubleshooting.

<li><a href="#">ipconfig /all -- Displays IP network configuration with information on all network interface cards present on the system. Provides information on: IP address, Host name, MAC address, Default gateway, DHCP

<li><a href="#">net user-- Displays a list of all users on the system. This command will allow an administrator to see a list of active accounts. These are accounts authorized to log on to the system. Viewing the permissions on these accounts will help the administrator determine if the user needs more or less access

<li><a href="#">net localgroup -- Displays a list of all local groups on the system.

<li><a href="#">net localgroup Administrator -- Displays users that are a part of the Administrator group. The Administrator group has more access and the ability to modify the system, so documenting any users in the group, particularly those that seem out of place, is essential.

<li><a href="#">net share -- Displays shared resources on the system.

<li><a href="#">It is important for surveyors to know what software is installed on the host. Surveyors should identify major software such as Operating System and control system software, and their version numbers, as this information will be used in later steps. Additionally, any unnecessary programs that are installed must be identified.

<li><a href="#">tasklist -- Surveyors should identify processes that are using large amounts of memory and further investigate. The process list should be compared to software documentation so that unknown processes can be identified and researched. Surveyors should identify any processes that do not need to be on the host (e.g. Server processes on a work station).

<li><a href="#">tasklist /svc -- Vendor software manuals should include a list of services. Comparing the list of services obtained through the tasklist to the software documentation can identify unknown or suspicious services. Any services found through the tasklist command, but not located in the documentation, should be investigated further. 

<li><a href="#">When investigating unknown or suspicious services online, surveyors should use at least three, preferably five, sources before making a determination on the service in question. Furthermore, surveyors surveyors should be wary of the credibility of some online sources and should utilize vendor sites if possible.

<li><a href="#">Netstat can be used to identify the listening connections, established connections, and ports opened by unknown or suspicious processes and services. Surveyors should also pay particular attention to remote connections. Foreign IPs and port 3389 can be indicative of a remote connection.

<li><a href="#">netstat -ano -- This command will show which files are loaded at startup and the registry keys associated with those files. The following is a description of what each switch (command option) for this command is accomplishing: 
<br> • a: displays the open ports and port status (listening or established) 
<br> • n: displays the addresses and port numbers in a numerical format 
<br> • o: displays the owning process ID (PID) associated with each connection 
<br> • b: details the open, listening, and established ports, and the IP address associated with each running process and service.

<li><a href="#">The ARP cache stores the IP address— address— MAC address pairings that the host machine has seen. The information presented by this command can be used to establish past connections that may not appear in the netstat command. If there are discrepancies between the network documentation and the results, it could indicate ARP spoofing where an attacker sends tailored ARP messages to reroute traffic intended for another host to one they control.

<li><a href="#">arp -a -- ARP cache entries are only maintained for a certain amount of time as defined by the operating system and configuration. As such, it will only display addresses that were recently seen.

<li><a href="#">Surveyors should note if the firewall is on or off. If the firewall is on, surveyors should also note any exclusions. Vendor software configuration manuals will list what firewall exclusions are required for their software to run, which should be used to ensure that the exclusions are correct and no unnecessary exclusions are enabled.

<li><a href="#">Surveyors should note which remote settings are selected.
<li><a href="#">Start -> Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Remote Settings

<li><a href="#">Event logs record significant events that occur on the host. These logs are broken up into the following three categories: 
<br> • Application: contains events logged by applications 
<br> • Security: contains security-related events such as logon events, policy changes, privilege use, and object access 
<br> • System: contains events logged by the Operating System

<li><a href="#">These events are categorized as error, warning, or information. Errors indicate a significant problem and should be researched further. A warning is not as severe as an error, though it may lead to possible problems in the future.

<li><a href="#">A list of event codes of particular interest include:
<br> • 4624 - Successful Logon
<br> • 4625 - Failed Logon
<br> • 4728 - Member added to security-enabled global group
<br> • 4732 - Member added to security-enabled local group
<br> • 4756 - Member added to security-enabled universal group
<br> • 1102 - Log Cleared
<br> • 4740 - User account locked out
<br> • 4663 - Object access attempt
<br> • 4719 - System audit policy was changed
<br> • 4657 - Registry value was changed
<br> • 4697 - Attempt was made to install a service
<br> • 5025 - Windows Firewall service has been stopped
<br> • 4954 - Group Policy settings for Windows Firewall was changed
<br> • 4947 - A rule was modified in the Windows Firewall exception list


<li><a href="#">Start -> Run... and type “ eventvwr” eventvwr” <Enter> to open the Windows event viewer
<li><a href="#">Windows stores important information regarding user profiles, system hardware, and installed programs in the registry. It is important to note that changes to the registry can cause considerable damage to the system; therefore, surveyors should be cautious when accessing the registry. A list of notable registry key locations is available in Appendix D. The surveyor should look for suspicious entries in these registry fields and validate all apps the operating system runs automatically. 

<li><a href="#">Start-> Run... and type “ regedit” regedit” <Enter> to open the Windows registry
<li><a href="#">Windows hides certain system files to protect them from tampering. However, malicious actors also hide files, so a review of hidden files is necessary. 

<li><a href="#">Start -> Control Panel -> Folder Options -> View -> Advanced Settings -> Show hidden files, folders, and drivers -> OK
<li><a href="#">Surveyors should pay particular attention to any new files or folders under System32 or in the temp directory. Additionally, any non-standard hidden files that have been recently modified should be investigated further.
