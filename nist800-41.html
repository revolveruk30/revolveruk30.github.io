<b>800-41 - Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#">Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that employ differing security postures. While firewalls are often discussed in the context of Internet connectivity, they may also have applicability in other network environments. For example, many enterprise networks employ firewalls to restrict to and from the internal networks used to service more sensitive functions, such as accounting or personnel.

<li><a href="#">TCP/IP communications are composed of four layers that work together to transfer data between hosts. When a user wants to transfer data across networks, the data is passed from the highest layer through intermediate layers to the lowest layer, with each layer adding more information. The lowest layer sends the accumulated data through the physical network, with the data then passed upwards through the layers to its destination.

<p>• <b>Application Layer</b>. This layer sends and receives data for particular applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

<p>• <b>Transport Layer</b>. This layer provides connection-oriented or connectionless services for transporting application layer services between networks, and can optionally ensure communications reliability. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are commonly used transport layer protocols.

<p>• <b>IP Layer/Network Layer</b>. This layer routes packets across networks. Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fundamental network layer protocol for TCP/IP. Other commonly used protocols at the network layer are Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), ICMP.

<p>• <b>Hardware Layer/Data Link Layer</b>. This layer handles communications on the physical network components. The best known data link layer protocol is Ethernet.

<li><a href="#">Addresses at the data link layer, which are assigned to network interfaces, are referred to as media access control (MAC) addresses— an example of this is an Ethernet address that belongs to an Ethernet card. Firewall policies rarely concern themselves with the data link layer. Addresses at the network layer are referred to as IP addresses. The transport layer identifies specific network applications and communication sessions as opposed to network addresses; a host may have any number of transport layer sessions with other hosts on the same network.

<li><a href="#">The transport layer may also include the notion of ports— ports— a destination port number generally identifies a service listening on the destination host, and a source port usually identifies the port number on the source host that the destination host should reply to. Transport protocols such as TCP and UDP have ports, while other transport protocols do not. The combination of source IP address and port with destination IP address and port helps define the session. The highest layer represents end user applications.

<li><a href="#">Basic firewalls operate on one or a few layers— typically the lower layers—while more advanced firewalls examine all of the layers. Those that examine more layers can perform more granular and thorough examinations.

<li><a href="#">Firewalls are often placed at the perimeter of a network. Such a firewall can be said to have an external and internal interface, with the external interface being the one on the outside of the network. These two interfaces are sometimes referred to as unprotected and protected, respectively.

<li><a href="#">The most basic feature of a firewall is the packet filter. Older firewalls that were only packet filters were essentially routing devices that provided access control functionality for host addresses and communication sessions. These devices, also known as stateless inspection firewalls, do not keep track of the state of each flow of traffic that passes though the firewall; this means, for example, that they cannot associate multiple requests within a single session to each other.

<li><a href="#">In their most basic form, firewalls with packet filters operate at the network layer. This provides network access control based on several pieces of information contained in a packet, including:<br>
<br>• The packet’s source IP address.
<br>• The packet’s destination address.
<br>• The network or transport protocol being used to communicate between source and destination hosts, such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP
<br>• The interface being traversed by the packet, and its direction (inbound or outbound).

<li><a href="#">Filtering inbound traffic is known as ingress filtering. Outgoing traffic can also be filtered, a process referred to as egress filtering. Organizations should only permit outbound traffic that uses the source IP addresses in use by the organization—a process that helps block traffic with spoofed addresses from onto other networks.

<li><a href="#">Many packet filters are unable to detect when a packet’s network layer addressing information has been spoofed or otherwise altered, or uses options that are permitted by standards but generally used for malicious purposes, such as IP source routing. Spoofing attacks, such as using incorrect in the packet headers, are generally employed by intruders to bypass the security controls implemented in a firewall platform.

<li><a href="#">Stateful inspection improves on the functions of packet filters by tracking the state of connections and blocking packets that deviate from the expected state. This is accomplished by incorporating greater awareness of the transport layer. Unlike packet filtering, stateful inspection keeps track of each connection in a state table. They typically include source IP address, destination IP address, port numbers, and connection state information. Stateful inspection in a firewall examines certain values in the TCP headers to monitor the state of each connection. Each new packet is compared by the firewall to the firewall’s state table to determine if the packet’s state contradicts its expected state. For example, it is common for firewalls to check attributes such as TCP sequence numbers and reject packets that are out of sequence.

<li><a href="#">Because some protocols, most notably UDP, are connectionless and do not have a formal process for initializing, establishing, and a connection, their state cannot be established at the transport layer as it is for TCP. For these protocols, most firewalls with stateful inspection are only able to track the source and destination IP addresses and ports. UDP packets must still match an entry in the state table based on source and destination IP address and port information to be permitted to pass—a DNS response from an external source would be permitted to pass only if the firewall had previously seen a corresponding DNS query from an internal source.

<li><a href="#">A newer trend in stateful inspection is the addition of a stateful protocol analysis capability, referred to by some vendors as deep packet inspection. Stateful protocol analysis improves upon standard stateful inspection by adding basic intrusion detection an inspection engine that analyzes protocols at the application layer to compare vendor-developed profiles of benign protocol activity against observed events to identify deviations. This allows a firewall to allow or deny access based on how an application is running over the network.

<li><a href="#">Firewalls with both stateful inspection and stateful protocol analysis capabilities are not full-fledged intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), usually offer much more extensive attack detection and prevention capabilities. For example, IDPSs also use signature-based and/or anomaly-based analysis to detect additional problems within network traffic.

<li><a href="#">An application-proxy gateway is a feature of advanced firewalls that combines lower-layer access control with upper-layer functionality. These firewalls contain a proxy agent that acts as an intermediary between two hosts that wish to communicate with each other, and never allows a direct connection between them. Each successful connection attempt actually results in the creation of two separate connections—one between the client and the proxy server, and another between the proxy server and the true destination.

<li><a href="#">Because external hosts only communicate with the proxy agent, internal IP addresses are not visible to the outside world. The proxy agent directly with the firewall ruleset to determine whether a given instance of network traffic should be allowed to transit the firewall. These gateways also perform the TCP handshake with the source system and are able to protect against exploitations at each step of a communication. A potential advantage is that some application-proxy gateways have the ability to decrypt packets (e.g., SSL-protected payloads), examine them, and re-encrypt them before sending them on to the destination host.

<li><a href="#">Firewalls with application-proxy gateways can also have several disadvantages when compared to packet filtering and stateful inspection. First, because of the “full packet awareness” of application-proxy gateways, the firewall spends much more time reading and interpreting each packet. Because of this, some of these gateways are poorly suited to high-bandwidth or real-time applications. Another disadvantage is that application-proxy gateways tend to be limited in terms of support for new network applications and protocols—an individual, application-specific proxy agent is required for each type of network traffic that needs to transit a firewall.

<li><a href="#">Because dedicated proxy servers have limited firewalling capabilities, such as simply blocking traffic based on its source or destination, they are typically deployed behind traditional firewall platforms. Typically, a main could accept inbound traffic, determine which application is being targeted, and hand off traffic to the appropriate proxy server (e.g., email proxy). This server would perform filtering or logging operations on the traffic, then forward it to internal systems.

<li><a href="#">Another common requirement for firewalls at the edge of a network is to perform client checks for incoming connections from remote users and allow or disallow access based on those checks. This checking, commonly called network access control (NAC) or network access protection (NAP), allows access based on the user’s credentials and the results of performing “health checks” on the user’s computer.

<li><a href="#">Many firewalls combine multiple features into a single system, the idea being that it is easier to set and maintain policy on a single system than on many that are deployed at the same location on a network. A typical unified threat management ( UTM) system has a firewall, malware detection and eradication, sensing and blocking of suspicious network probes, and so on.

<li><a href="#">Host-based firewalls are available as part of server operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and they can also be installed as third-party add-ons. Configuring a host- based firewall to allow only necessary traffic to the server provides protection against malicious activity from all hosts, including those on the same subnet or on other internal subnets not separated by a network firewall. Many host-based firewalls can also act as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that, after detecting an attack in progress, take actions to thwart the attacker and prevent damage to the targeted host.

<li><a href="#">Firewalls can only work effectively on traffic that they can inspect. Firewalls cannot read application data that is encrypted, such as email that is encrypted using the S/MIME or OpenPGP protocols, or files that are manually encrypted. Another limitation faced by some firewalls is understanding traffic that is tunneled, even if it is not encrypted. For example, IPv6 traffic can be tunneled in IPv4 in many different ways. The content may still be unencrypted, but if the firewall does not understand the particular tunneling mechanism used, the traffic cannot be interpreted.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should use firewalls wherever their internal networks and systems interface with external networks and systems, and where security requirements vary among their internal networks. Since one of the primary functions of a firewall is to prevent unwanted traffic from entering a network (and, in some cases, from exiting it), firewalls should be placed at the edge of logical network boundaries.

<li><a href="#">Typically, a NAT acts as a router that has a network with private addresses on the inside and a single public address on the outside. The way a NAT performs this many-to-one mapping varies between implementations, but almost always involves the following:<br>

<br>• Hosts on the inside network initiating connections to the outside network cause the NAT to map the source port of the connection to a different source port that is controlled by the NAT. The NAT uses this source port number to map connections from the outside back to the host on the inside.

<br>• Hosts on the outside of the network cannot initiate contact with hosts on the inside network. In some firewalls, the NAT can be configured to map a particular destination port on the NAT to a particular host on the inside of the NAT.

<li><a href="#">A typical situation that requires multiple layers of network firewalls is the presence of internal users with varying levels of trust. Another typical use for firewalls inside a network with a firewall at its edge involves visitors who need access to the Internet. Many organizations deploy specific access points within their networks for visitor use. A firewall between the access points and the rest of the internal network can prevent visitors from accessing the local network with the same privileges as an employee.

<li><a href="#">Placing a firewall within a network that already has one at the edge requires good planning and policy coordination to prevent inadvertent security lapses. When designing policies for an inner firewall, the administrator could make assumptions that result in poor policy choices—for example, if the inner firewall’s administrator assumes that the outer firewall is already preventing certain types of traffic from reaching the inner firewall, and the outer firewall’s administrator later modifies existing policy, hosts behind the inner firewall will be exposed to additional threats. A better approach is to duplicate outer firewall policies that are also relevant for inner firewalls on each inner firewall.

<li><a href="#">Before a firewall policy is created, some form of risk analysis should be performed to develop a list of the types of traffic needed by the organization and categorize how they must be secured—including which types of traffic can traverse a firewall under what circumstances. Generally, firewalls should block inbound and outbound traffic that has not been expressly permitted by the firewall policy—traffic that is not needed by the organization. This practice, known as deny by default, decreases the risk of attack and can also reduce the volume of traffic carried on the organization’s networks.

<li><a href="#">Firewall policies should only allow necessary IP protocols through. Examples of commonly used IP protocols, with their IP protocol numbers, are ICMP (1), TCP (6), and UDP (17). Other IP protocols, such as IPsec components Encapsulating Security (ESP) (50) and Authentication Header (AH) (51) and routing protocols, may also need to pass through firewalls. These necessary protocols should be restricted whenever possible to the specific hosts and networks within the organization with a need to use them. By permitting only necessary protocols, all unnecessary IP protocols are denied by default.

<li><a href="#">Traffic with an invalid source address for incoming traffic or destination address for outgoing traffic (an invalid “external” address) should be blocked at the network perimeter. This traffic is often caused by malware, spoofing, denial of service attacks, or misconfigured equipment.

<li><a href="#">Examples of relatively common invalid IPv4 addresses are 127.0.0.0/8 (also known as the localhost addresses) and 0.0.0.0 (interpreted by some operating systems as a localhost or a broadcast address). These have no legitimate use on a network. Also, traffic using link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/8) should be blocked. Address ranges specified in RFC 1918 should also be blocked: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16.

<li><a href="#">Traffic containing IP source routing information, allows a system to specify the routes that packets will employ while traveling from source to destination. This could potentially permit an attacker to construct a packet that bypasses network security controls.

<li><a href="#">As with other aspects of firewall rulesets, deny by default policies should be used for incoming TCP and UDP traffic. Less stringent policies are generally used for outgoing TCP and UDP traffic because most organizations permit their users to access a wide range of external applications located on millions of external hosts.

<li><a href="#">The application-based approach provides an additional layer of security for incoming traffic by validating some of the traffic before it the desired server. The theory is that the inbound application firewall’s or proxy’s additional security layer can protect the server better than the server can protect itself—and can also remove malicious traffic before it reaches the server to help reduce server load. An application firewall or proxy also prevents the server from having direct access to the outside network.

<li><a href="#">Some organizations have mandates about when firewalls should block connections that are considered to be inactive, when applications should disconnect sessions if there is no activity. A different type of firewall policy based on network activity is one that throttles or redirects traffic if the rate of traffic matching the policy rule is too high. For example, a firewall might redirect the connections made to a particular inside address to a slower route if the rate of connections is above a certain threshold. Another policy might be to drop incoming ICMP packets if the rate is too high.

<li><a href="#">As with any new technology deployment, firewall planning and should be addressed in a phased approach. A successful firewall deployment can be achieved by following a clear, step-by-step planning and implementation process.

<li><a href="#">Basic principles that organizations should follow in the planning of firewall deployments include:<br>
<br>• Use devices as they were intended to be used. Firewalls should not be constructed of equipment not meant for firewall use. For example, routers are meant to handle routing, not highly complex filtering, which can cause an excess burden on the router’s processor.

<br>• Create defense-in-depth. In the case of firewalls, defense-in-depth can be accomplished by using multiple firewalls throughout an organization, including at the perimeter, in front of sensitive internal departments, and on individual computers.

<br>• Pay attention to internal threats. Focusing attention solely on threats leaves the network wide open to attacks from within. Important internal systems should be placed behind internal firewalls.

<br>• Document the firewall’s capabilities. Each model of firewall has different capabilities and limitations.

<li><a href="#">The details of creating a ruleset vary by type of firewall and specific products. For example, many firewalls check traffic against rules in a sequential manner until a match is found. For these firewalls, rules with the highest chance of matching traffic patterns should be placed as high in the list as possible to improve firewall performance. Other firewalls have more complex ways of processing rulesets, such as first checking “deny” rules and then checking “allow” rules.

<li><a href="#">Most firewalls allow each rule in a ruleset to have a comment. Filling in such a comment is important for others to determine why a rule was made. Comments are also quite useful to people auditing rulesets. Although commenting rules may seem trivial, it can be quite valuable later and takes little effort.

<li><a href="#">Changes to firewall rulesets or policies impact and should be managed as part of a formal configuration management process. Be aware that firewall rulesets can become increasingly complicated with age. For example, a new firewall ruleset might contain entries to accommodate only outbound user traffic and inbound email traffic (along with allowing the return inbound connections required by TCP/IP)—but will likely contain far more rules by the time the firewall system reaches the end of its first year in production.

<li><a href="#">It is important to review the firewall policy often. Such a review can uncover rules that are no longer needed as well as new policy requirements that need to be added to the firewall. Some firewalls have tools that can do automated reviews of policies, looking for such things as redundant rules or missing rules that are widely recommended.

<li><a href="#">Organizations may want to consider conducting penetration testing to assess the overall security of their network environment. This testing can be used to verify that a firewall ruleset is performing as intended by generating network traffic and monitoring how it is handled by the firewall in comparison with its expected response. Penetration testing should be employed in addition to, rather than instead of, a conventional audit program.
