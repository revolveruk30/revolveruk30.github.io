This is done by creating or modifying the `scripts.ini` or `psscripts.ini` files. The scripts are stored in the following paths: - `<GPOPath>\\Machine\\Scripts\\` - `<GPOPath>\\User\\Scripts\\` #### Possible investigation steps - This attack abuses a legitimate mechanism of Active Directory, so it is important to determine whether the activity is legitimate and the administrator is authorized to perform this operation. - Retrieve the contents of the `ScheduledTasks.xml` file, and check the `<Command>` and `<Arguments>` XML tags for any potentially malicious commands or binaries. - Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours. - Scope which objects may be compromised by retrieving information about which objects are controlled by the GPO. ### False positive analysis - Verify if the execution is legitimately authorized and executed under a change management process. ### Related rules - Group Policy Abuse for Privilege Addition - b9554892-5e0e-424b-83a0-5aef95aa43bf - Scheduled Task Execution at Scale via GPO - 15a8ba77-1c13-4274-88fe-6bd14133861e ### Response and remediation - Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage. - The investigation and containment must be performed in every computer controlled by the GPO, where necessary. - Remove the script from the GPO. - Check if other GPOs have suspicious scripts attached. - Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector. - Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR). ## Setup The 'Audit Detailed File Share' audit policy must be configured (Success Failure).

This detection rule was created based on activity represented in exploitation of vulnerability (CVE-2020-1350) also known as [SigRed]() during July 2020. #### Possible investigation steps - This specific rule is sourced from network log activity such as DNS or network level data. It's important to validate the source of the incoming traffic and determine if this activity has been observed previously within an environment. - Activity can be further investigated and validated by reviewing any associated Intrusion Detection Signatures (IDS) alerts. - Further examination can include a review of the `dns.question_type` network fieldset with a protocol analyzer, such as Zeek, Packetbeat, or Suricata, for `SIG` or `RRSIG` data. - Validate the patch level and OS of the targeted DNS server to validate the observed activity was not large-scale internet vulnerability scanning. - Validate that the source of the network activity was not from an authorized vulnerability scan or compromise assessment. #### False positive analysis - Based on this rule, which looks for a threshold of 60k bytes, it is possible for activity to be generated under 65k bytes and related to legitimate behavior. In packet capture files received by the [SANS Internet Storm Center](), byte responses were all observed as greater than 65k bytes. - This activity can be triggered by compliance/vulnerability scanning or compromise assessment; it's important to determine the source of the activity and potentially allowlist the source host. ### Related rules - Unusual Child Process of dns.exe - 8c37dc0e-e3ac-4c97-8aa0-cf6a9122de45 - Unusual File Modification by dns.exe - c7ce36c0-32ff-4f9a-bfc2-dcb242bf99f9 ### Response and remediation - Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage. - Ensure that you have deployed the latest Microsoft [Security Update]() (Monthly Rollup or Security Only) and restarted the patched machines. If unable to patch immediately, Microsoft [released]() a registry-based workaround that doesnâ€™t require a restart. This can be used as a temporary solution before the patch is applied. - Maintain backups of your critical systems to aid in quick recovery. - Perform routine vulnerability scans of your systems, monitor [CISA advisories]() and patch identified vulnerabilities. - If you observe a true positive, implement a remediation plan and monitor host-based artifacts for additional post-exploitation behavior. references = [ , , , ] risk_score = 47 rule_id = "11013227-0301-4a8c-b150-4db924484475" severity = "medium" tags = ["Elastic", "Network", "Threat Detection", "Lateral Movement", "Investigation Guide"] timestamp_override = "event.ingested" type = "query = " event.category:(network or network_traffic) and destination.port:53 and (event.dataset:zeek.dns or type:dns or event.type:connection) and network.bytes > 60000 " [[rule.threat]] framework = "MITRE ATT&CK" [[rule.threat.technique]] id = "T1210" name = "Exploitation of Remote Services" reference = [rule.threat.tactic] id = "TA0008" name = "Lateral Movement"
