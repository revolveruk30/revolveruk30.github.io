<b>27005 - Information Security Risk Management</b>
<P>
<li><a href="#">Risk management analyses what can happen and what the possible consequences can be, before deciding what should be done and when, to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.

<li><a href="#">Information security risk management should contribute to the following:
<br> • risks being identified;
<br> • risks being assessed in terms of their consequences
<br> • the likelihood and consequences of these risks being communicated;
<br> • priority order for risk treatment being established;
<br> • priority for actions to reduce risks occurring;
<br> • effectiveness of risk treatment monitoring;
<br> • risks being monitored and reviewed regularly

<li><a href="#">An iterative approach to conducting risk assessment can increase depth and detail of the assessment at each iteration. The iterative approach provides a good balance between minimizing the time and effort spent in identifying controls, while still ensuring that high risks are appropriately assessed.

<li><a href="#">The context is established first. Then, a risk assessment is conducted. If this provides sufficient information to effectively determine the actions required to modify the risks to an acceptable level, then the task is complete and the risk treatment follows. If the information is insufficient, another iteration of the risk assessment with revised context (e.g. risk evaluation criteria, risk acceptance criteria or impact criteria) is conducted, possibly on limited parts of the total scope.

<li><a href="#">The external and internal context for information security risk management should be established, which involves setting the basic criteria necessary for information security risk management, defining the scope and boundaries, and establishing an appropriate organization operating the information security risk management.

<li><a href="#">7.2.1 Risk management approach. An appropriate risk management approach should be selected or developed that addresses basic criteria such as: risk evaluation criteria, impact criteria, risk acceptance criteria.

<li><a href="#">7.3 Scope and boundaries. The scope of the information security risk management process needs to be defined to ensure that all relevant assets are taken into account in the risk assessment. In addition, the boundaries need to be identified to address those risks that can arise through these boundaries.

<li><a href="#">7.4 Organization for information security risk management. The organization and responsibilities for the information security risk management process should be set up and maintained.

<li><a href="#">The following are the main roles and responsibilities of this organization:
<br> • development of the information security risk management process suitable for the organization;
<br> • identification and analysis of the stakeholders;
<br> • definition of roles and responsibilities of all parties both internal and external to the organization

<li><a href="#">8.1 General description of information security risk assessment. Risks should be identified, quantified or qualitatively described, and prioritized against risk evaluation criteria and objectives relevant to the organization.

<li><a href="#">A risk is a combination of the consequences that would follow from the occurrence of an unwanted event and the likelihood of the occurrence of the event. Risk assessment quantifies or qualitatively describes the risk and enables managers to prioritize risks according to their perceived seriousness or other established criteria.

<li><a href="#">Risk assessment determines the value of the information assets, identifies the applicable threats and vulnerabilities that exist (or can exist), identifies the existing controls and their effect on the risk identified, determines the potential consequences and, finally, prioritizes the derived risks and ranks them against the risk evaluation criteria set in the context establishment.

<li><a href="#">Risk assessment is often conducted in two (or more) iterations. First, a high level assessment is carried out to identify potentially high risks that warrant further assessment. The next iteration can involve further in-depth consideration of potentially high risks revealed in the initial iteration.


<li><a href="#">8.2.1 Introduction to risk identification. The purpose of risk identification is to determine what can happen to cause a potential loss, and to gain insight into how, where and why the loss can happen.

<li><a href="#">8.2 Identification of assets. The assets within the established scope should be identified.

<li><a href="#">An asset is anything that has value to the organization and which, therefore, requires protection. For the identification of assets, it should be borne in mind that an information system consists of more than hardware and software. Asset identification should be performed at a suitable level of detail that provides sufficient information for the risk assessment.

<li><a href="#">An asset owner should be identified for each asset, to provide responsibility and accountability for the asset. The asset owner perhaps does not have property rights to the asset, but has responsibility for its production, development, maintenance, use and security as appropriate. The asset owner is often the most suitable person to determine the asset's asset's asset's value to the organization.

<li><a href="#">8.2.3 Identification of threats and their sources should be identified.

<li><a href="#">A threat has the potential to harm assets such as information, processes and systems and, therefore, organizations. Threats can be of natural or human origin, and can be accidental or deliberate. Both accidental and deliberate threat sources should be identified. A threat can arise from within or from outside the organization.

<li><a href="#">Internal experience from incidents and past threat assessments should be considered in the current assessment. It can be worthwhile to consult other threat catalogs (maybe specific to an organization or business) to complete the list of generic threats, where relevant.

<li><a href="#">8.2.4 Identification of existing controls. Existing and planned controls should be identified.

<li><a href="#">Identification of existing controls should be made to avoid unnecessary work or cost, e.g. in the duplication of controls. An existing or planned control can be identified as ineffective, or not sufficient, or not justified. If not justified or not sufficient, the control should be checked to determine whether it should be removed, replaced by another, more suitable control, or whether it should stay in place, for example, for cost reasons.

<li><a href="#">8 .2.5 Identification of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threats to cause harm to assets or to the organization should be identified.

<li><a href="#">Vulnerabilities can be identified in following areas: organization; processes and procedures; management routines; personnel; physical environment; information system configuration; hardware, software or communications equipment; dependence on external parties.

<li><a href="#">The presence of a vulnerability does not cause harm in itself, as there needs to be a threat present to exploit it. A vulnerability that has no corresponding threat may not require the implementation of a control, but should be recognized and monitored for changes.

<li><a href="#">8.2.6 Identification of consequences. The consequences that losses of confidentiality, integrity and availablity may have on the assets should be identified. Assets can have assigned values both for their financial cost and because of the business consequences if they are damaged or compromised.

<li><a href="#">Organizations should identify the operational consequences of incident scenarios in terms of (but not limited to): Investigation and repair time; (work)time lost; opportunity lost; health and safety; financial l cost of specific skills to repair the damage; and image reputation and goodwill.

<li><a href="#">8.3.1 Risk analysis methodologies. A risk analysis is methodology can be qualitative or quantitative, or a combination of these, depending on the circumstances. In practice, qualitative analysis is often used first to obtain a general indication of the level of risk and to reveal the major risks. Later, it can be necessary to undertake more specific or quantitative analysis on the major risks.

<li><a href="#">An advantage of qualitative analysis is its ease of understanding by all relevant personnel while a disadvantage is the dependence on subjective choice of the scale.

<li><a href="#">Quantitative risk analysis uses a scale with numerical values (rather than the descriptive scales used in qualitative risk analysis) for both consequences and likelihood, using data from a variety of sources. A disadvantage of the quantitative approach can occur where factual, auditable data is not available, thus creating an illusion of worth and accuracy of the risk assessment.

<li><a href="#">8.3.2 Assessment of consequences. The business impact on the organization that can result from possible or actual information security incidents should be assessed, taking into account the consequences of a breach of information security such as loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of the assets.

<li><a href="#">Asset valuation begins with the classification of assets according to their criticality, in terms of their importance to fulfilling the business objectives of the organization. Valuation is then determined using two measures:

<br> • the replacement value of the asset: the cost of recovery clean- up and replacing the information (if at all possible);

<br> • the business consequences of loss or compromise of the asset, such as the potential adverse business and/or legal or regulatory consequences from the disclosure, modification, non-availability and/or destruction of information, and other information assets.


<li><a href="#">8.3.3 Assessment of incident likelihood. The likelihood of the incident scenarios should be assessed.

<li><a href="#">After identifying the incident scenarios, it is necessary to assess the likelihood of each scenario and impact occurring, using qualitative or quantitative analysis techniques. This should take account of how often the threats occur and how easily the vulnerabilities can be exploited, considering:

<br> • experience and applicable statistics for threat likelihood;
<br> • for deliberate threat sources: the motivation and capabilities, which change overtime, and resources available to possible attackers, as well as the perception of attractiveness and vulnerability of assets for a possible attacker;
<br> • for accidental threat sources: geographical factors, e.g. proximity to chemical or petroleum plants, the possibility of extreme weather conditions, and factors that can influence human errors and equipment malfunction;
<br> • vulnerabilities, both individually and in aggregation;
<br> • existing controls and how effectively they reduce vulnerabilities.

<li><a href="#">8.3.4 Level of risk determination. The level of risk should be determined for all relevant incident scenarios.

<li><a href="#">Risk analysis is based on assessed consequences and likelihood. Additionally, it can consider cost benefit, the concerns of stakeholders, and other variables, as appropriate for risk evaluation.

<li><a href="#">8.4 Risk evaluation. Level of risks should be compared against risk evaluation criteria and risk acceptance criteria.

<li><a href="#">9.1 Information security risk treatment. Controls to reduce, retain, avoid, or share the risks should be selected and a risk treatment plan defined.

<li><a href="#">When large reductions in risks can be obtained with relatively low expenditure, such options should be implemented. Further, options for improvements can be uneconomic and judgement needs to be exercised whether they are justifiable.

<li><a href="#">The four options for risk treatment are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes, the organization can benefit substantially by a combination of options such as reducing the likelihood of risks, reducing their consequences, and sharing or retaining any residual risks.

<li><a href="#">Once the risk treatment plan has been defined, residual risks need to be determined. This involves an update or re- iteration of the risk assessment, taking into account the expected effects of the proposed risk treatment. Should the residual risk still not meet the organization's risk acceptance criteria, a further iteration of risk treatment can be necessary before proceeding to risk acceptance.

<li><a href="#">9.2 Risk modification. The level of risk should be managed by introducing, removing or altering controls so that the residual risk can be reassessed as being acceptable.

<li><a href="#">In general, controls can provide one or more of the following types of protection: correction, elimination, prevention, impact minimization, deterrence, detection, recovery, monitoring and awareness. During control selection, it is important to weigh the cost of acquisition, implementation, administration, operation, monitoring, and maintenance of the controls against the value of the assets being protected.

<li><a href="#">9.3 Risk retention. The decision on retaining the risk without further action should be taken depending on risk evaluation.

<li><a href="#">If the level of risk meets the risk acceptance criteria, there is no need for implementing additional controls and the risk can be retained.

<li><a href="#">9.4 Risk avoidance. The activity or condition that gives rise to the particular risk should be avoided.

<li><a href="#">When the identified risks are considered too high, or the costs of implementing other risk treatment options exceed the benefits, a decision can be made to avoid the risk completely, by withdrawing from a planned or existing activity or set of activities, or changing the conditions under which the activity is operated.

<li><a href="#">9.5 Risk sharing. The risk should be shared with another party that can most effectively manage the particular risk depending on risk evaluation.

<li><a href="#">Sharing can be done by an insurance that covers the consequences, or by sub-contracting a partner whose role is to monitor the information system and take immediate actions to stop an attack before it makes a defined level of damage.
<li><a href="#">It should be noted that it can be possible to share the responsibility to manage risk but it is not normally possible to share the liability of an impact.

<li><a href="#">10 Information security risk acceptance. The decision to accept the risks and responsibilities for the decision should be made and formally recorded.

<li><a href="#">11 Information security risk communication and consultation. Information about risk should be exchanged and/or shared between the decision-maker and other stakeholders.

<li><a href="#">Risk communication should be carried out in order to:
<br> • avoid or reduce both occurrence and consequence of information security breaches due to the lack of mutual understanding among decision-makers and stakeholders;
<br> • support decision making;
<br> • obtain new information security knowledge.

<li><a href="#">12.1 Monitoring and review of risk factors. Risks and their factors (i.e. value of assets, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood of occurrence) should be monitored and reviewed to identify any changes in the context of the organization at an early stage, and to maintain an overview of the complete risk picture.
