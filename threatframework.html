<b>NSA - Technical Cyber Threat Framework</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#">Administration: This stage provides the necessary foundational resources and direction to drive targeted operations. During this stage, the adversary derives their operational intent, plans campaigns, performs research and analysis, and develops resources.
<li><a href="#">Planning is an orderly, analytical process that consists of a logical set of activities to analyze a mission, select the best course of action, and produce operational plans. Based upon the resulting plans, the adversary identifies mission needs and requirements.
<li><a href="#">Resource development activities aid with fulfilling the mission needs. Resource types include: infrastructure, software, data, people, and support to conduct operations. Resource development also includes activities such as the training and education of people, or cultivating of alliances and partnerships. 
<li><a href="#">Research activities are adversary activities performed to identify gaps and ideate ways to fill those gaps, through technical, mechanical, physical, financial, or other means. 
<li><a href="#">Preparation: Actions taken by a threat actor to assess the intended victim cyber threat environment and assess success/failure of threat activities in meeting objectives. 
<li><a href="#">Reconnaissance is the act of obtaining and examining information about the activities and resources of a potential target, or capturing data and characteristics of a particular target system or network. An adversary conducts reconnaissance to strategize their targeted operation with the goal of making the intrusion more efficient and to increase the probability of success.
<li><a href="#">Passive reconnaissance involves no interaction with the target directly. It includes cyber activities such as open source research to gather publicly available information.
<li><a href="#">Active reconnaissance involves attempts to interact with the target directly. Activities include port, network and vulnerability scanning, and network enumeration techniques, such as banner grabbing and TCP fingerprinting. The desired result is a profile and enumeration of target access points, protocols, and vulnerabilities to exploit. 
<li><a href="#">Staging: includes allocating and preparing supporting infrastructure, such as command and control nodes, hop points, DNS infrastructure, and necessary accounts (email, chat, etc.). During these activities, the adversary ensures tools, infrastructure and communication channels are identified and deliverable.
<li><a href="#">Engagement: Adversary activities taken by a threat actor against a specific target/target set prior to gaining, but with the intent to gain, access to the victim's physical or virtual computer or information system(s), network(s), and/or data stores. 
<li><a href="#">Delivery: Deliver a malicious payload to the target via technical, cognitive, or physical means with the goal of exploiting target vulnerabilities in technology, people, or processes. he most commonly used remote methods include spear phishing, malicious websites and via remote exploits, but can also be delivered through social engineering or insider threats. 
<li><a href="#">Exploitation: Use network, system, physical and/or social vulnerabilities to establish unauthorized access to a target. Adversary activities to leverage vulnerabilities in people, processes, or technology. 
<li><a href="#">Credential Access: Adversarial activities to obtain, create, hijack, and leverage legitimate credentials within a target system or network. These activities include credential dumping, network sniffing with the intent of gaining credentials, keylogging on a target system, leveraging legitimate password recovery techniques, hijacking active authentication tokens, or merely searching file systems for credentials in files. 
<li><a href="#">Presence: Actions taken by the threat actor once access to target/target set physical or virtual computer or information system has been achieved. Adversary activities to ensure ongoing and robust access to the victim and potentially its connected environment.
<li><a href="#">Execution: Unauthorized threat actor actions (automated or manual) that direct or execute actions or activities using available target's computer(s), information system(s), and/or network(s). Actions taken by an adversary to run malicious or controlled code on a local or remote system. 
<li><a href="#">Internal reconnaisance: Activities an adversary performs on the victim network that support traversing the network and compromising additional hosts or connected networks. Activities include internal network scanning, directory walks, active directory dumps, password dumps, and identification of target systems and users. 
<li><a href="#">Credential access: Adversarial activities to obtain, create, hijack, and leverage legitimate credentials within a target system or network. These activities include credential dumping, network sniffing with the intent of gaining credentials, keylogging on a target system, leveraging legitimate password recovery techniques, hijacking active authentication tokens, or merely searching file systems for credentials in files. 
<li><a href="#">Privilege escalation: Activities an adversary performs on the victim network to support obtaining administrative rights. Adversary uses information from external and/or internal reconnaissance, social engineering, or other means to attempt to obtain administrative rights by using a variety of tools and tactics. Some examples include using password hash exploitation tools, leveraging legitimate account credentials, and using open source or custom exploits. 
<li><a href="#">Lateral movement: Adversarial activities to propagate through the victim environment. Within this objective, the adversary may attempt establishing new user credentials to further propagate on the network. 
<li><a href="#">Persistence: Activities performed to maintain presence on the system, device, and/or network. Activities include creating legitimate credentials, installing rootkits, establishing remote access tools.
<li><a href="#">Monitor: Activities such as maintaining presence on a host, establishing a compromised host as a listening post, identifying health and status of the host, and waiting to perform additional operations. 
<li><a href="#">Modify: Activities to modify target systems, networks, resources, or information. These modifications could be changing configuration files, removing data files, sending unauthorized email from a target account, or installing additional malicious files. 
<li><a href="#">Deny: Activities that result in the denial of target systems, networks, or other resources, as well as denying access to information. These activities may be the result of Denial of Service attacks, or by virtue of modifying or destroying components of the target. 
<li><a href="#">Destroy: Activities to destroy target systems, networks, resources, or information. Attacks cause a wide range of consequences ranging from minor to significant damage to the target. 
<li><a href="#">Analysis, Evaluation, and Feedback: Activities to continually analyze, evaluate, and update the operation to best perform their mission at any point in the target operation activities. This activity is a similar concept to the Observe Orient Decide Act (OODA) loop for the adversary. 
<li><a href="#">Command and Control: Activities to direct and receive information from a victim. Activities include the transmission of location, health, or operational status of persistent access capabilities and the remote tasking of access capabilities. 
<li><a href="#">Exfiltrate: Observable activities include gathering files, internally staging those files, obfuscating file types and formats, compressing into archive files, and transmitting files. Transmission could occur through standard protocols, remote access tools, or a variety of other methods such as email, chat, cloud services, and more. 
<li><a href="#">Evasion: Activities to minimize the risk of being caught within a victim host and their environment. Evasion techniques can vary, based on the stage, particular Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), and sophistication of the adversary. Some examples include saving malware with legitimate file types, using encryption or covert channels for communications, or performing command and control using social networking sites. 
<li><a href="#">Conduct social engineering: Psychological manipulation of people by threat actor into performing actions or divulging information. 
<li><a href="#">Gather credentials: Activities to obtain credentials of unknowing users for the purpose of future engagement. 
<li><a href="#">Map accessible networks: The sending of transmissions to the network's possible nodes, examining the responses they receive identify the existence of nodes on the network. The results potentially provide insight to identify security systems and policies on the network. 
<li><a href="#">Scan devices: Active or passive actions taken by the adversary in order to determine the software or firmware currently used by a target, versions of software or firmware, a target's patch status, and configuration (e.g., ports open). 
<li><a href="#">Identify crosstalk: Any phenomenon by which a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel creates an unintended effect on another circuit or channel that is not physically connected. 
<li><a href="#">Add exploits to application data files: Altering the content of data files to exploit a weakness in the application that parses that type of data file. The change causes that application to perform unintended actions, usually code execution or revealing sensitive information. 
<li><a href="#">Scrape websites: The gathering of information about a potential target by searching open source information such as public forums, conference announcements, bulletin boards, or distribution lists looking for victim information; includes the use of automated tools to overcome protection measures. 
<li><a href="#">Create midpoints: Configure, acquire, compromise, or develop one or more intermediate nodes between source and destination for data exfiltration and command and control. 
<li><a href="#">Establish physical proximity: Threat actor actions taken to obtain facilities and infrastructure in close physical proximity to identified target's computer or information systems, networks, and/or data stores. 
<li><a href="#">Use social media: The gathering of information about a potential target by searching public social media sites. 
<li><a href="#">Infect or seed website: A website that has been created or modified by a threat actor to include malicious code, which can subsequently be used in phishing attacks, drive-by attacks and watering hole attacks. 
<li><a href="#">Alter communications path: Modify communications paths by altering cache entries or routing tables using a variety of protocols to deliver a payload or redirect victims to fraudulent and malicious web sites and systems. 
<li><a href="#">Compromise supply chain or trusted source: Adding malicious software, hardware, or configurations to items that are trusted to be non-malicious while on their way to the target network. 
<li><a href="#">Connect removable media: The deployment of malicious code via removable media. Removable media can be programmed to auto-run upon insertion of a device, causing malware to be automatically executed. 
<li><a href="#">Connect rogue network devices: The insertion or use of existing rogue interfaces to authorized network devices. 
<li><a href="#">Inject database command: The injection of malicious SQL commands into unchecked input fields, allowing data theft, modifications, or execution of malicious commands. 
<li><a href="#">Leverage device swapping: Any instance in which an information system, either unaccredited or accredited for a specific network, is moved from said network to a secondary network without authorization.
<li><a href="#">Send malicious email: Embeds malicious attachments or links within an email message, sent to a target. The user's computer can be compromised after opening or executing the attached file, upon clicking the link, or upon loading the email itself, and potentially providing access to a malicious actor. 
<li><a href="#">Use compromised host: The process of delivering malicious code from a previously compromised victim host to a target within the victim's network to be used to gain further access. 
<li><a href="#">Use legitimate remote access: The use of legitimate remote access capabilities without exploiting a vulnerability usually involving the reuse of legitimate credentials that were captured previously to gain access to internal network resources. 
<li><a href="#">Abuse protocols: Threat actor use of standard target system or network protocols to gain unauthorized access through unanticipated use of the protocol. 
<li><a href="#">Access virtual memory: Abusing physical collocation of separate/isolated virtual spaces (e.g., virtual machines, containers, processes) to compromise the integrity or confidentiality of targeted virtual resources. 
<li><a href="#">Defeat encryption: Exploitation of cryptographic algorithms or device implementations of cryptography, or using acquired cryptographic keys to gain access to or manipulate the underlying unencrypted content. 
<li><a href="#">Exploit local application vulnerability: Exploiting a software vulnerability in an application by having the exploit triggered locally on the host, often requiring some user interaction to launch and usually leading to user level access on the host. This occurs when a programming or logical error is triggered that causes the software to behave in an unintended and insecure way. 
<li><a href="#">Exploit OS vulnerability: Exploiting a software vulnerability in a default operating system service or kernel. This occurs when a programming or logical error is triggered that causes the OS to behave in an unintended and insecure way. Exploiting OS vulnerabilities often leads directly to privileged access on the host. 
<li><a href="#">Exploit weak access controls: Exploitation of weak, misconfigured, or missing access controls to gain access to a system or data. 
<li><a href="#">Launch zero-day exploit: A zero-day (0-day) exploit is a vulnerability in software that is not publicly disclosed or is unknown to the vendor, which is then exploited by the threat actor before the vendor becomes aware and/or fixes it. 
<li><a href="#">Leverage exploit packs: Threat actor makes use of exploit packs (also called an exploit kit), a toolkit that automates the exploitation of client side vulnerabilities, usually targeting browsers and programs that a website can invoke through the browser. 
<li><a href="#">Leverage trusted relationship: Leverage compromise of a connected peer network or other trusted relationship with another network. 
<li><a href="#">Replay: Threat actors conduct a network attack against a target in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. 
<li><a href="#">Create scheduled task: Task scheduling is used to execute programs on a scheduled basis to persist adversary code or gain SYSTEM privileges. Task scheduling requires administrator privileges, but tasks may be configured to run with SYSTEM privileges, representing an escalation of privilege 
<li><a href="#">Inject into running process: Injecting malicious code into an existing legitimate process. Running code in the context of another process provides many benefits such as access to the process's memory, permissions, and identity. Code injection masks the malicious activity from casual inspection of the task list. 
<li><a href="#">Replace existing binary: Threat actor actions taken to replace a legitimate or pre-existing binary with a malicious executable in a commonly trusted location, from a legitimate source, or named with a common name to bypass tools that trust executables by relying on file name or path. 
<li><a href="#">Run commands in shell: Invoke individual commands from the command line to run executable code. This can be done locally or remotely - and interactively. Commands that are executed run with current permission level of the command line. 
<li><a href="#">Run fileless payload: Run fileless payload only in memory without an executable file or script on disk. 
<li><a href="#">Enumerate accounts and permissions: Adversaries attempt to get a listing of all local or domain accounts and their permissions, including reviewing logins or file modification times to identify primary users. Adversaries get a listing of all local groups and their permissions and members. 
<li><a href="#">Enumerate file system: Adversaries enumerate all files and directories in certain areas of a host or remote share or perform a targeted search for specific files or directories; also known as a directory walk. 
<li><a href="#">Enumerate local network connections: Adversaries attempt to get a listing of all network connections. 
<li><a href="#">Enumerate OS and software: An adversary attempts to get detailed information about the OS including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries attempt to get a listing of software or drivers that are installed on the system and their configurations. 
<li><a href="#">Enumerate processes: Adversaries attempt to get information about running processes. This could also include enumerating loaded libraries that are part of the running processes, or registered services. 
<li><a href="#">Sniff network: Network sniffing is when the network is monitored to capture credentials. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode, using a utility to capture traffic in transit over the network or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data. 
<li><a href="#">Add or modify credentials: Account creation and manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment; an adversary must already have sufficient permissions on the domain or systems. 
<li><a href="#">Dump credentials: Credential dumping is obtaining information from weaknesses in operating system or software that can be used to login to the operating system. Utilities do this in many different ways: extracting credential hashes for off-line cracking, extracting plaintext passwords, or finding Kerberos tickets. 
<li><a href="#">Locate credentials: Adversaries search for local file systems, remote file shares, network traffic, and other systems on the network for files or activity containing passwords. 
<li><a href="#">Log keystrokes: Use of software/hardware that records keystrokes and keyboard events. 
<li><a href="#">Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. Threat actors use valid, captured password hashes for the account to authenticate as the user. 
<li><a href="#">Create new service: Create a new service started by the operating system by directly modifying the registry (or similar construct) or by using tools which do so. 
<li><a href="#">Modify links: Links redirect from one location to another location. The adversary may edit or create a link so that data or execution occurs in an alternate location than intended to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. 
<li><a href="#">Compress data: Data is compressed prior to exfiltration to minimize the amount of data sent over the network or to make the contents of the data less obvious. 
<li><a href="#">Send over C2 channel: Data exfiltration is performed over the adversary command and control channel. Data is transferred through the channel using the same protocol as command and control communications. 
<li><a href="#">Throttle data: Data is arranged into defined chunks instead of whole files, or packet sizes are limited. This approach may be used to avoid operational limitations dealing with logical or physical transfer constraints related to transmission protocols. 
<li><a href="#">Access raw disk: Programs with direct drive access may read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures. This enables covert storage and avoids operating system visibility. 
<li><a href="#">Employ rootkit: Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying OS API calls that supply system information. Rootkit functionality may reside at the user level, kernel level in the OS, or lower, to include a hypervisor, MBR, or the BIOS. Adversaries use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, connections, services, and/or drivers. 
<li><a href="#">Obfuscate data: Make data more difficult to analyze by selectively replacing or otherwise concealing its contents; includes executables and network traffic. 
<li><a href="#">Remove logged data: The deletion or modification of generated log/event files on a host system. This may compromise the integrity of the security solution causing security events to go unreported or impeding incident response. 
<li><a href="#">Degrade security products: Disable, disrupt, or otherwise evade security tools to avoid detection. This can take the form of killing processes, deleting registry keys so that tools do not start at run time, or other methods to prevent the intended operation. 
<li><a href="#">Employ anti-forensics measures: Threat actor actions to destroy or obfuscate data artifacts: (beyond logs and files) that would indicate their presence on target computer(s), information system(s), and/or network(s), and thereby render target-initiated forensic analysis difficult or impossible. 
<li><a href="#">Employ anti-reverse-engineering measures : Use a variety of activities to evade reverse engineering efforts
<li><a href="#">Encrypt data: Data is encrypted to hide the target information, increasing inspection difficulty. This action is performed on the data at rest or in transit. Adversaries encrypt data to protect or conceal the specific activities. 
<li><a href="#">Impersonate legitimate file: Placing a file in a commonly trusted location (such as C:\Windows\System32) or naming a file with a common name (such as "explorer.exe" or "svchost.exe"). This also may be done to deceive defenders and system administrators into thinking a file is benign by name association to something that is known to be legitimate. 
<li><a href="#">Mimic legitimate traffic: Actions to avoid detection by blending in with existing traffic. This could include using standard protocols and ports, similar volume, same time of day, source and destinations, and types of traffic that occur internally within an enclave. 
<li><a href="#">Modify malware to avoid detection: If malware is detected and quarantined, an adversary may be able to determine why the malware was detected, modify the malware, and send an updated version that is no longer detected by security tools. 
<li><a href="#">Sign malicious content: Signing malicious code using stolen, self-generated, or compromised private keys, since signed content is either required by the operating system or often trusted by default. 
<li><a href="#">Store files in unconventional location: Data or executables may be stored in file system metadata, slack space, registry, outside logical partition, or some other unconventional location instead of directly in files to evade file monitoring tools.
