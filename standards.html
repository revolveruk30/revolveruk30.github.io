<b>800-30 - Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments</b>
<P>
<li><a href="#">Risk assessment is a key component of a holistic, organization-wide risk management process as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39 , Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View. Risk management processes include: (i) framing risk; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) responding to risk; and (iv) monitoring risk.
<li><a href="#">The first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a risk context— that is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. The purpose of the risk framing component is to produce a risk management strategy that addresses how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk— making explicit and transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both investment and operational decisions.
<li><a href="#">The second component of risk management addresses how organizations assess risk within the context of the organizational risk frame. The purpose of the risk assessment component is to identify: (i) threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed through organizations against other organizations or the Nation; (ii) vulnerabilities internal and external to organizations; (iii) the harm (i.e., adverse impact) that may occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and (iv) the likelihood that harm will occur. The end result is a determination of risk (i.e., typically a function of the degree of harm and likelihood of harm occurring).
<li><a href="#">The third component of risk management addresses how organizations respond to risk once that risk is determined based on the results of a risk assessment. The purpose of the risk response component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide response to risk in accordance with the organizational risk frame by: (i) developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk; (ii) evaluating the alternative courses of (iii) determining appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance; and (iv) implementing risk responses based on selected courses of action.
<li><a href="#">The fourth component of risk management addresses how organizations monitor risk over time. The purpose of the risk monitoring component is to: (i) determine the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses (consistent with the organizational risk frame); (ii) identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems and the environments in which the systems operate; and (iii) verify that planned risk responses are implemented and information security requirements derived from and traceable to organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines are satisfied.
<li><a href="#">This publication focuses on the risk assessment component of risk management— providing a step-by-step process for organizations on: (i) how to prepare for risk assessments; (ii) how to conduct risk assessments; (iii) how to communicate risk assessment results to key organizational personnel; and (iv) how to maintain the risk assessments over time.
<li><a href="#">Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. Information security risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems.
<li><a href="#">Risk assessment is the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information security risks. Assessing risk requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information to determine the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur.
<li><a href="#">A risk assessment methodology typically includes: (i) a risk assessment process (ii) an explicit risk model, defining key terms and assessable risk factors and the relationships among the factors; (iii) an assessment approach (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, or semi-qualitative), specifying the range of values those risk factors can assume; and (iv) an analysis approach (e. g., threat-oriented, asset/ impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented).
<li><a href="#">Risk assessment methodologies are defined by organizations and are a component of the risk management strategy developed during the risk framing step of the risk management process. By making explicit the risk model, the assessment approach, and the analysis approach employed, and requiring as part of the assessment process, a rationale for the assessed values of risk factors, organizations can increase the reproducibility and repeatability of risk assessments.
<li><a href="#">Risk models define the risk factors to be assessed and the relationships among those factors. Risk factors are characteristics used in risk models as inputs to determining levels of risk in risk assessments. Typical risk factors include threat, vulnerability, impact, likelihood, and predisposing condition. Risk factors can be decomposed into more detailed characteristics (e.g., threats decomposed into threat sources and threat events).
<li><a href="#">These definitions are important for organizations to document prior to conducting risk assessments because the assessments rely upon well-defined attributes of threats, vulnerabilities, impact, and other risk factors to effectively determine risk.
<li><a href="#">A threat is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service.
<li><a href="#">Threat events are caused by threat sources. A threat source is characterized as: (i) the intent and method targeted at the exploitation of a vulnerability; or (ii) a situation and method that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability. In general, types of threat sources include: (i) hostile cyber or physical attacks; (ii) human errors of omission or commission; (iii) structural failures of organization-controlled resources (e.g., hardware, software, environmental controls); and (iv) natural and man-made disasters, accidents, and failures beyond the control of the organization.
<li><a href="#">Risk models differ in the degree of detail and complexity with which threat events are identified. When threat events are identified with great specificity, threat scenarios can be modeled, developed, and analyzed. Threat events for cyber or physical attacks are characterized by the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by adversaries.
<li><a href="#">Threat shifting is the response of adversaries to perceived safeguards and/or countermeasures (i.e., security controls), in which adversaries change some characteristic of their intent/ targeting in order to avoid and/or overcome those safeguards/ countermeasures. Threat shifting is a natural consequence of a dynamic set of interactions between threat sources and types of organizational assets targeted. With more sophisticated threat sources, it also tends to default to the path of least resistance to exploit particular vulnerabilities, and the responses are not always predictable.
<li><a href="#">A vulnerability is a weakness in information system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. Most information system vulnerabilities can be associated with security controls that either have not been applied (either intentionally or unintentionally), or have been applied, but retain some weakness.
<li><a href="#">The tendency for security controls to potentially degrade in effectiveness over time reinforces the need to maintain risk assessments during the entire system development life cycle and also the importance of continuous monitoring programs to obtain ongoing situational awareness of the organizational security posture.
<li><a href="#">In general, risks materialize as a result of a series of threat events, each of which takes advantage of one or more vulnerabilities. Organizations define threat scenarios to describe how the events caused by a threat source can contribute to or cause harm. Development of threat scenarios is analytically useful, since some vulnerabilities may not be exposed to exploitation unless and until other vulnerabilities have been exploited.
<li><a href="#">A predisposing condition is a condition that exists within an organization, a mission or business process, enterprise architecture, information system, or environment of operation, which affects (i.e., increases or decreases) the likelihood that threat events, once initiated, result in adverse impacts. Predisposing conditions include, for example, the location of a facility in a hurricane or flood-prone region (increasing the likelihood of exposure to hurricanes or floods) or a stand-alone information system with no external network connectivity (decreasing the likelihood of exposure to a network-based cyber attack).
<li><a href="#">The likelihood of occurrence is a weighted risk factor based on an analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability (or set of vulnerabilities).
<li><a href="#">For adversarial threats, an assessment of likelihood of occurrence is typically based on: (i) adversary intent; (ii) adversary capability; and (iii) adversary targeting. For other than adversarial threat events, the likelihood of occurrence is estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, or other factors. Organizations assess the overall likelihood as a combination of likelihood of initiation/ occurrence and likelihood of resulting in adverse impact.
<li><a href="#">In assessing likelihoods, organizations examine vulnerabilities that threat events could exploit and also the mission/ business function susceptibility to events for which no security controls or viable implementations of security controls exist.
<li><a href="#">The level of impact from a threat event is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of information or information system availability.
<li><a href="#">Risk is a function of the likelihood of a threat event’s occurrence and potential adverse impact should the event occur. For purposes of risk communication, risk is generally grouped according to the types of adverse impacts.
<li><a href="#">Organizations may use risk aggregation to roll up discrete or lower-level risks into a more general or higher-level risk. Aggregation, conducted primarily at Tiers 1 and 2 and occasionally at Tier 3, assesses the overall risk to organizational operations, assets, and individuals given the set of discrete risks.
<li><a href="#">When aggregating risk, organizations consider the relationship among various discrete risks. For example, there may be a cause and effect relationship in that if one risk materializes, another risk is more or less likely to materialize. Risk coupling or correlation (i.e., finding relationships among risks that increase or decrease the likelihood of any specific risk materializing) can be done at Tiers 1, 2, or 3.
<li><a href="#">Uncertainty is inherent in the evaluation of risk, due to such considerations as: (i) limitations on the extent to which the future will resemble the past; (ii) imperfect or incomplete knowledge of the threat (e.g., characteristics of adversaries including tactics, techniques, and procedures); (iii) undiscovered vulnerabilities in technologies or products; and (iv) unrecognized dependencies, which can lead to unforeseen impacts.
<li><a href="#">Risk, and its contributing factors, can be assessed in a variety of ways, including quantitatively, qualitatively, or semi-quantitatively. Each risk assessment approach considered by organizations has advantages and disadvantages. A preferred approach (or situation-specific set of approaches) can be selected based on organizational culture.
<li><a href="#">Quantitative assessments typically employ a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based on the use of numbers. This type of assessment most effectively supports cost-benefit analyses of alternative risk responses or courses of action. Additionally, the rigor of quantification is significantly lessened when subjective determinations are buried within the quantitative assessments, or when significant uncertainty surrounds the determination of values.
<li><a href="#">In contrast to quantitative assessments, qualitative assessments typically employ a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based on nonnumerical categories or levels (e.g., very low, moderate, high, very high). This type of assessment supports communicating risk results to decision makers. Additionally, unless each value is very clearly defined or is characterized by meaningful examples, different experts relying on their individual experiences could produce significantly different results.
<li><a href="#">Finally, semi-quantitative assessments typically employ a set of methods, or rules for assessing risk that uses bins, scales, or representative numbers whose values and meanings are not maintained in other contexts. This type of assessment can provide the benefits of quantitative and qualitative assessments.
<li><a href="#">An analysis approach can be: (i) threat-oriented; (ii) asset/ impact-oriented; or (iii) vulnerability-oriented.
<br> • A threat-oriented approach starts with the identification of threat sources and threat events, and focuses on the development of threat scenarios; vulnerabilities are identified in the context of threats, and for adversarial threats, impacts are identified based on adversary intent.
<br> • An asset/ impact-oriented approach starts with the identification of impacts or consequences of concern and critical assets, possibly using the results of a mission or business impact analyses and identifying threat events that could lead to and/or threat sources that could seek those impacts or consequences.
<br> • A vulnerability-oriented approach starts with a set of predisposing conditions or exploitable weaknesses/deficiencies in organizational information systems or the environments in which the systems operate, and identifies threat events that could exercise those vulnerabilities together with possible consequences of vulnerabilities being exercised.
<li><a href="#">Differences in the starting point of the risk assessment can potentially bias the results, causing some risks not to be identified. Therefore, identification of risks from a orientation (e.g., complementing a threat-oriented analysis approach with an asset/impact-oriented analysis approach) can improve the rigor and effectiveness of the analysis.
<li><a href="#">Risk assessments can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy— organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level.
<li><a href="#">Traditional risk assessments generally focus at the Tier 3 level (i.e., information system level) and as a result, tend to overlook other significant risk factors that may be more appropriately assessed at the Tier 1 or Tier 2 levels (e.g., exposure of a core mission/business function to an adversarial threat based on information system interconnections).
<li><a href="#">Risk assessments support risk response decisions at the different tiers of the risk management hierarchy.
<br> • At Tier 1, risk assessments can affect, for example: (i) organization-wide information security programs, policies, procedures, and guidance; (ii) the types of appropriate risk responses (i.e., risk acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, or transfer); (iii) investment decisions for information technologies/systems.
<br> • At Tier 2, risk assessments can affect, for example: (i) enterprise architecture/ security architecture design decisions; (ii) the selection of common controls; (iii) the selection of suppliers, services, and contractors to support organizational missions/ business functions;
<br> • At Tier 3, risk assessments can affect, for example: (i) design decisions (including the selection, tailoring, and supplementation of security controls and the selection of information technology products for organizational information systems); (ii) implementation decisions (including whether specific information technology products or product configurations meet security control requirements); and (iii) operational decisions (including the requisite level of monitoring activity, the frequency of ongoing information system authorizations, and system maintenance decisions).
<li><a href="#">At Tier 1, risk assessments support organizational strategies, policies, guidance, and processes for managing risk assessments conducted at Tier 1 focus on organizational operations, assets, and individuals— comprehensive assessments across mission/business lines. At Tier 2, risk assessments support the determination of mission/business process protection and resiliency requirements, and the allocation of those requirements to the enterprise architecture as part of mission/business segments (that support mission/business processes). Risk assessment results produced at Tier 2 are communicated to and shared with organizational entities at Tier 3 to help inform and guide the allocation of security controls to information systems and environments in which those systems operate.
<li><a href="#">In the Initiation phase, risk assessments evaluate the anticipated vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems in the context of the planned environments of operation.
<br> • RMF Step 1 – Categorize : Organizations can use initial risk assessments to make security categorization decisions consistent with the risk management strategy
<br> • RMF Step 2 – Select: Organizations can use risk assessments to inform and guide the selection of security controls for organizational information systems and environments of operation.
<br> • RMF Step 3 – Implement: Organizations can use risk assessment results to identify alternative implementations of selected security controls. Individual configuration settings for information technology products and system components can eliminate vulnerabilities identified during the analysis of threat events.
<br> • RMF Step 4 – Assess: Organizations can use the results from security control assessments to inform risk assessments.
<br> • RMF Step 5 – Authorize: Organizations can use risk assessment results to provide risk-related information to authorizing officials. Risk assessment results provide essential information to enable authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions on whether to operate those systems in the current security posture or take actions to provide additional security controls.
<br> • RMF Step 6 – Monitor: Organizations can update risk assessments on an ongoing basis using security-related information from organizational continuous monitoring processes.
<li><a href="#">The risk assessment process entails ongoing communications and information sharing among stakeholders to ensure that: (i) the inputs to such assessments are as accurate as possible; (ii) intermediate assessment results can be used, for example, to support risk assessments at other tiers; and (iii) the results are meaningful and useful inputs to the risk response step in the risk management process.
<li><a href="#">The risk assessment process is composed of four steps: (i) prepare for the assessment; (ii) conduct the assessment; (iii) communicate assessment results; and (iv) maintain the assessment. Each step is divided into a set of tasks. For each task, supplemental guidance provides additional information for organizations conducting risk assessments.
<li><a href="#">Preparing for a risk assessment includes the following tasks:
<br> • Identify the purpose of the assessment;
<br> • Identify the scope of the assessment;
<br> • Identify the assumptions and constraints associated with the assessment;
<br> • Identify the sources of information to be used as inputs to the assessment; and
<br> • Identify the risk model and analytic approaches (i.e., assessment and analysis approaches) to be employed during the assessment.
<li><a href="#">The second step in the risk assessment process is to conduct the assessment. The objective of this step is to produce a list of information security risks that can be prioritized by risk level and used to inform risk response decisions. Conducting risk assessments includes the following specific tasks:
<br> • Identify threat sources that are relevant to organizations;
<br> • Identify threat events that could be produced by those sources;
<br> • Identify vulnerabilities within organizations that could be exploited by threat sources through specific threat events and the predisposing conditions that could affect successful exploitation;
<br> • Determine the likelihood that the identified threat sources would initiate specific threat events and the likelihood that the threat events would be successful;
<br> • Determine the adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the exploitation of vulnerabilities by threat sources (through specific threat events); and
<br> • Determine information security risks as a combination of likelihood of threat exploitation of vulnerabilities and the impact of such exploitation, including any uncertainties associated with the risk determinations.
<li><a href="#">The third step in the risk assessment process is to communicate the assessment results and share risk-related information. The objective of this step is to ensure that decision makers across the organization have the appropriate risk-related information needed to inform and guide risk decisions. Communicating and sharing information consists of the following specific tasks:
<br> • Communicate the risk assessment results; and
<br> • Share information developed in the execution of the risk assessment, to support other risk management activities.
<li><a href="#">The fourth step in the risk assessment process is to maintain the assessment. The objective of this step is to keep current, the specific knowledge of the risk organizations incur.
<li><a href="#">Risk monitoring provides organizations with the means to, on an ongoing basis: (i) determine the effectiveness of risk responses; (ii) identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate; and (iii) verify compliance. Maintaining risk assessments includes the following specific tasks:
<br> • Monitor risk factors identified in risk assessments on an ongoing basis and understanding subsequent changes to those factors; and
<br> • Update the components of risk assessments reflecting the monitoring activities carried out by organizations.
