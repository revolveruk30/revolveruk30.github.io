<b>800-94 - Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems</b>
<P>
<li><a href="#">Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events in a computer system or network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. 
<li><a href="#">Incidents have many causes, such as malware (e.g., worms, spyware), attackers gaining unauthorized access to systems from the Internet, and authorized users of systems who misuse their privileges or attempt to gain additional privileges for which they are not authorized.
<li><a href="#">An intrusion detection system (IDS) is software that automates the intrusion detection process. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is software that has all the capabilities of an intrusion detection system and can also attempt to stop possible incidents.
<li><a href="#">Some IDPSs are also able to change their security profile when a new threat is detected. For example, an IDPS might be able to collect more detailed information for a particular session after malicious activity is detected within that session.
<li><a href="#">IPS technologies can respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which can be divided into the following groups:
<li><a href="#">The IPS stops the attack itself. 
<li><a href="#">• Terminate the network connection or user session that is being used for the attack
<li><a href="#">• Block access to the target (or possibly other likely targets) from the offending user account
<li><a href="#">• Block all access to the targeted host, service, application, or other resource.
<li><a href="#">The IPS changes the security environment. 
<li><a href="#">• The IPS could change the configuration of other security controls to disrupt an attack.
<li><a href="#">• Some IPSs can even cause patches to be applied to a host if the IPS detects that the host has vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="#">The IPS changes the attack’s content.
<li><a href="#">• A simple example is an IPS removing an infected file attachment from an e-mail and then permitting the cleaned email to reach its recipient.
<li><a href="#">When an IDPS incorrectly identifies benign activity as being malicious, a false positive has occurred. When an IDPS fails to identify malicious activity, a false negative has occurred. It is not possible to eliminate all false positives and negatives; in most cases, reducing the occurrences of one increases the occurrences of the other. 
<li><a href="#">Many organizations choose to decrease false negatives at the cost of increasing false positives, which means that more malicious events are detected but more analysis resources are needed to differentiate false positives from true malicious events. Altering the configuration of an IDPS to improve its detection accuracy is known as tuning. 
<li><a href="#">A signature is a pattern that corresponds to a known threat. Signature-based detection is the process of comparing signatures against observed events to identify possible incidents.
<li><a href="#">Signature-based detection is very effective at detecting known threats but largely ineffective at detecting previously unknown threats, disguised by the use of evasion techniques, and many variants of known threats.
<li><a href="#">Anomaly-based detection is the process of comparing definitions of what activity is considered normal against observed events to identify significant An IDPS using anomaly-based detection has profiles that represent the normal behavior of such things as users, hosts, network connections, or applications.
<li><a href="#">Profiles can be developed for many behavioral attributes, such as the number of e-mails sent by a user, the number of failed login attempts for a host, and the level of processor usage for a host in a given period of time.
<li><a href="#">Unlike anomaly-based detection, which uses host or network-specific profiles, stateful protocol analysis relies on vendor-developed universal profiles that specify how particular protocols should and should not be used.
<li><a href="#">Stateful protocol analysis can identify unexpected sequences of commands, such as issuing the same command repeatedly or issuing a command without first issuing a command upon which it is dependent.
<li><a href="#">The primary drawback to stateful protocol analysis methods is that they are very resource-intensive because of the complexity of the analysis and the overhead involved in performing state tracking for many simultaneous sessions. Another serious problem is that stateful protocol analysis methods cannot detect attacks that do not violate the characteristics of generally acceptable protocol behavior.
<li><a href="#">There are many types of IDPS technologies, which are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they can recognize and the methodologies that they use to identify possible incidents. Four types of IDPS technologies:
<li><a href="#">• Network-Based, which monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and analyzes the network and application protocol activity to identify suspicious activity. 
<li><a href="#">• Wireless, which monitors wireless network traffic and analyzes it to identify suspicious activity involving the wireless networking protocols themselves. 
<li><a href="#">• Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), which examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows, such as DDoS attacks, scanning, and certain forms of malware. 
<li><a href="#">• Host-Based, which monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host for suspicious activity.
<li><a href="#">The typical components in an IDPS solution are as follows:
<li><a href="#">• Sensors and agents monitor and analyze activity. The term sensor is typically used for IDPSs that monitor networks. The term agent is typically used for host-based IDPS technologies.
<li><a href="#">• A management server is a centralized device that receives information from the sensors or agents and manages them. Some management servers perform analysis on the event information that the sensors or agents provide. Matching event information from multiple sensors or agents, such as finding events triggered by the same IP address, is known as correlation. 
<li><a href="#">• A database server is a repository for event information recorded by sensors, agents, and/or management servers.
<li><a href="#">• A console is a program that provides an interface for the IDPS’s users and administrators. Console software is typically installed onto standard desktop or laptop computers.
<li><a href="#">Data fields commonly used by IDPSs include event date and time, event type, importance rating (e.g., priority, severity, impact, confidence), and prevention action performed (if any).
<li><a href="#">IDPS technologies typically permit administrators to store logs locally and send copies of logs to centralized logging servers
<li><a href="#">Generally, logs should be stored both locally and centrally to support the integrity and availability of the data.
<li><a href="#">Also, IDPSs should have their clocks synchronized using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) or through frequent manual adjustments so that their log entries have accurate timestamps.
<li><a href="#">Most IDPSs require at least some tuning and customization to improve their detection accuracy, usability, and effectiveness.
<li><a href="#">Typically, the more powerful a product’s tuning and customization capabilities are, the more its detection accuracy can be improved from the default configuration.
<li><a href="#">Examples of such capabilities are as follows:
<li><a href="#">• A threshold is a value that sets the limit between normal and abnormal behavior. Thresholds usually specify a maximum acceptable level, such as x failed connection attempts in 60 seconds, or x characters for a filename length.
<li><a href="#">• A blacklist is a list of discrete entities, such as hosts, TCP or UDP port numbers, ICMP types and codes, applications, usernames, URLs, filenames, or file extensions, that have been previously determined to be associated with malicious activity. A whitelist is a list of discrete entities that are known to be benign.
<li><a href="#">Securing IDPS components is very important because IDPSs are often targeted by attackers. If an attacker can compromise an IDPS, it can be rendered useless in detecting subsequent attacks against other hosts.
<li><a href="#">Specific security recommendations are as follows:
<li><a href="#">• Administrators should create separate accounts for each user and administrator of the IDPS, and assign each account only the necessary privileges.
<li><a href="#">• Administrators should configure firewalls, routers, and other packet filtering devices to limit direct access to all IDPS components to only those hosts that need such access.
<li><a href="#">• Administrators should ensure that all IDPS management communications are protected appropriately, either through physical (e.g., management network) or logical (e.g., management VLAN) separation, or through encryption of communications.
<li><a href="#">Most consoles offer drill-down capabilities, which means that when a user examines an alert, more details and information are available in layers. This allows users to see basic information on many alerts at once, and to show additional information on particular events of interest as needed.
<li><a href="#">There are two types of IDPS updates: software updates and signature updates. Software updates fix bugs in the IDPS software or add new functionality, while signature updates add new detection capabilities or refine existing detection capabilities (e.g., reducing false positives).
<li><a href="#">For any IDPS, administrators should back up configuration settings periodically and before applying software or signature updates to ensure that existing settings are not inadvertently lost.
<li><a href="#">Network-based IDPSs typically perform most of their analysis at the application layer. They also analyze activity at the transport and network layers both to identify attacks at those layers and to facilitate the analysis of the application layer activity (e.g., a TCP port number may indicate which application is being used). Some network-based IDPSs also perform limited analysis at the hardware layer.
<li><a href="#">Sensors can be deployed in one of two modes:
<li><a href="#">• An inline sensor is deployed so that the network it is monitoring must pass through it, much like the traffic flow associated with a firewall.
<li><a href="#">The primary motivation for deploying IDPS sensors inline is to enable them to stop attacks by blocking network traffic.
<li><a href="#">• A passive sensor is deployed so that it monitors a copy of the actual network traffic; no traffic actually passes through the sensor. Passive sensors are typically deployed so that they can monitor key network locations, 
<li><a href="#">Passive sensors can monitor traffic through various methods, including the following:
<li><a href="#">• Many switches have a spanning port, which is a port that can see all network traffic going through the switch. Connecting a sensor to a spanning port can allow it to monitor traffic going to and from many hosts.
<li><a href="#">• A network tap is a direct connection between a sensor and the physical network media itself, such as a fiber optic cable. The tap provides the sensor with a copy of all network traffic being carried by the media.
<li><a href="#">• An IDS load balancer is a device that aggregates and directs network traffic to monitoring systems, including IDPS sensors. A load balancer can receive copies of network traffic from one or more spanning ports or network taps and aggregate traffic from different networks.
<li><a href="#">Data fields commonly logged by network-based IDPSs include the following:
<li><a href="#">• Timestamp
<li><a href="#">• Connection or session ID
<li><a href="#">• Event or alert type
<li><a href="#">• Rating (e.g., priority, severity, impact, confidence)
<li><a href="#">• Source and destination IP addresses
<li><a href="#">• Source and destination TCP or UDP ports
<li><a href="#">• Number of bytes transmitted
<li><a href="#">• Decoded payload data, such as application requests and responses
<li><a href="#">The types of events most commonly detected by network-based IDPS sensors include the following:
<li><a href="#">• Application layer reconnaissance and attacks (e.g., banner grabbing, buffer overflows, format string attacks, password guessing, malware transmission). Most network-based IDPSs analyze several dozen application protocols. Commonly analyzed ones include DNS, HTTP.
<li><a href="#">• Transport layer reconnaissance and attacks (e.g., port scanning, unusual packet fragmentation, SYN floods). The most frequently analyzed transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP.
<li><a href="#">• Network layer reconnaissance and attacks (e.g., spoofed IP addresses, illegal IP header values). The most frequently analyzed network layer are IPv4, ICMP, and IGMP. Many products are also adding support for IPv6 analysis.
<li><a href="#">• Unexpected application services (e.g., tunneled protocols, backdoors, hosts running unauthorized application services). These are usually detected through stateful protocol analysis methods, which can determine if the activity in a connection is with the expected application protocol, or through anomaly detection methods, which can identify changes in network flows and open ports on hosts.
<li><a href="#">• Policy violations (e.g., use of inappropriate Web sites, use of forbidden application protocols). Some types of security policy violations can be detected by IDPSs that allow administrators to specify the characteristics of activity that should not be permitted, such as TCP or UDP port numbers, IP addresses, Web site names, and other pieces of data that can be identified by examining network traffic.
<li><a href="#">Although network-based IDPSs offer extensive detection capabilities, they do have some significant limitations. Three of the most important are analyzing encrypted network traffic, handling high traffic loads, and withstanding attacks against the IDPSs themselves.
<li><a href="#">Network-based IDPSs cannot detect attacks within encrypted network traffic, including virtual private network (VPN) connections, HTTP over SSL (HTTPS), and SSH sessions. Organizations should use IDPSs that can analyze the payloads before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted.
<li><a href="#">Network-based IDPSs may be unable to perform full analysis under high loads. Passive IDPS sensors might drop some packets, which could cause some incidents to go undetected.
<li><a href="#">An attack technique, known as blinding, generates network traffic that is likely to trigger many IDPS alerts in a short period of time. In many cases, the blinding traffic is not intended to actually attack any targets. An attacker runs the “real” attack separately at the same time as the blinding traffic. The attacker’s goal is that the blinding traffic will either cause the IDPS to fail in some way or generate so many alerts that the alerts for the real attack go unnoticed.
<li><a href="#">Network-based IDPS sensors offer various prevention capabilities, including the following:
<li><a href="#">• Ending the Current TCP Session. A passive sensor can attempt to end an existing TCP session by sending TCP reset packets to both endpoints; this is sometimes called session sniping. 
<li><a href="#">• Throttling Bandwidth Usage. IDPS sensors can limit the percentage of network bandwidth that the protocol can use.
<li><a href="#">• Reconfiguring Other Network Security Devices. Many IDPS sensors can instruct network security devices such as firewalls, routers, and switches to reconfigure themselves to block certain types of activity or route it elsewhere.
<li><a href="#">Several products only analyze network traffic, and other products only check the integrity of a host’s critical files. Specific techniques commonly used in host- based IDPSs include the following:
<li><a href="#">• Code behavior analysis. Before code is run normally on a host, it can first be executed in a virtual environment or a sandbox to analyze its behavior and compare it to profiles or rules of known good and bad behavior.
<li><a href="#">• Buffer overflow detection. Attempts to perform stack and heap buffer overflows can be detected by looking for their typical characteristics, such as certain sequences of instructions and attempts to access portions of memory other than those allocated to the process.
<li><a href="#">• System call monitoring. The agent knows which applications and processes should be calling which other applications and processes or performing certain actions. Agents can also restrict which drivers can be loaded, which can prevent the installation of rootkits and other attacks.
<li><a href="#">• Application and library lists. An agent might monitor each application and library (e.g., dynamic link library [DLL]) that a user or process attempts to load and compare that information to lists of authorized and unauthorized applications and libraries.
<li><a href="#">• Network Traffic Filtering. Agents often include a host-based firewall that can restrict incoming and outgoing traffic for each application on the system, preventing unauthorized access and acceptable use policy violations.
<li><a href="#">• File integrity checking. This involves periodically generating message digests or other cryptographic checksums for critical files, comparing them to reference values, and identifying differences.
<li><a href="#">• File attribute checking. This is periodically checking the attributes of important files, such as ownership and permissions, for changes.
<li><a href="#">• File access attempts. An agent with a filesystem shim can monitor all attempts to access critical files, such as system binaries, and stop attempts that are suspicious.
<li><a href="#">• Log Analysis. Some agents can monitor and analyze OS and application logs to identify malicious activity. These logs may contain information on system events, which are operational actions performed by OS components (e.g., shutting down the system, starting a service).
<li><a href="#">• Network Configuration Monitoring. Some agents can monitor a host’s current network configuration and detect changes to it.
<li><a href="#">Host-based IDPSs limitations include the following:
<li><a href="#">• Centralized Reporting Delays. Many host-based IDPSs are intended to forward their alert data to the management servers on a periodic basis, not in a near-real-time fashion. This can cause delays in initiating response actions, which especially increases the impact of incidents that spread quickly, such as malware infestations.
<li><a href="#">• Host Resource Usage. Unlike the other IDPS technologies, host-based IDPSs involve running agents on the hosts being monitored. These agents can consume considerable host resources, including memory, processor usage, and disk storage. 
<li><a href="#">• Conflicts with Existing Security Controls. Installing an agent can cause existing host security controls to be disabled automatically, such as firewalls, if those controls are perceived to duplicate functionality provided by the agent.
