<b>27008 - Guidelines for Auditors On Information Security Controls</b>
<P>

<li><a href="#">Information security controls are the primary means of treating unacceptable information risks, bringing them within the organization's risk tolerance level.

<li><a href="#">A technical assessment is generally performed either manually and/or with the assistance of automated tools. A technical assessment may be performed by a role not involved in executing the control, e. g. a system owner, or by staff in charge of the specific controls, or by internal or external information security experts.

<li><a href="#">Information security control assessments, and technical assessments in particular, can help an organization to:
<br> • identify and understand the potential organizational impacts of inadequately mitigated information security threats and vulnerabilities;
<br> • confirm that previously identified or emergent information security vulnerabilities and threats have been adequately addressed;
<br> • support budgetary decisions within the investment process and other management decisions relating to improvement of organization's information security management.

<li><a href="#">When an individual information security control assessment commences, the information security auditors normally start by gathering preliminary information, reviewing the planned scope of work, liaising with managers and other contacts in the applicable parts of the organization.

<li><a href="#">Preliminary information can come from a variety of sources:
<br> • books, Internet searches, technical manuals, technical security standards and policies of the organization, and other general background research into common risks and controls in this area.
<br> • results of prior assessments, tests, and audits, whether partially or fully aligned with the present assessment scope and whether or not conducted by information security auditors
<br> • information on relevant information security incidents, near-misses, support issues and changes.

<li><a href="#">The assessment checklist (or similar) is a key document for several reasons:
<br> • it provides structure for the work, helping to ensure that the planned scope is adequately covered;
<br> • the analysis necessary to generate the checklist prepares the information security auditors for the assessment fieldwork that follows.
<br> • it can be reviewed by audit management or other information security auditors as part of the assessment quality assurance process

<li><a href="#">Having completed the review checklist, conducted a series of review tests and interviews with relevant parties and gathered sufficient review evidence, the information security auditors should be in a position to examine the evidence, determine the extent to which information security risks have been treated, and review the potential impact of any residual risks.

<li><a href="#">Information security auditors can use four review methods during information security control reviews: process analysis; examination; testing and validation techniques; sampling techniques.

<li><a href="#">Testing and validation can involve automated tools that can be resource-intensive. The potential impact of such tools on operations should be considered when planning their use, for instance scheduling reviews for off-peak times. When a part of the review relies on such a tool, the information security auditor should demonstrate, or provide evidence, that the tool provides reliable results, which establishes the integrity of the tool.

<li><a href="#">Directly assessing information security controls such as examination and testing is not always possible or sufficient to be assured of their effectiveness and suitability in operation. It can be more appropriate, or necessary, to deduce the effectiveness and suitability of the controls by analysing the associated processes or activities for evidence confirming that they are: 
<br> • designed to provide the desired control effects in theory; 
<br> • correctly implemented;
<br> • operating as designed; 
<br> • being administered, monitored and managed correctly; and 
<br> • actually providing the intended control effects in practice.

<li><a href="#">The operational and administrative processes or activities are the context within which controls operate, and normally provide evidence of their operation in the form of records, log entries, etc. In particular, the generation and processing of records such as alerts, alarms, events and incident reports by controls generally indicates that they are functional, but can be insufficient to confirm that they are reliable and fully effective. Analysis of the associated processes and activities (e.g. checking procedures, observing and/or interviewing the people involved) in practice provides additional assurance, along with tests to confirm it, that data, criteria or situations, which are expected to trigger the controls, in fact do so.

<li><a href="#">Examination techniques are a form of review method that facilitates understanding, achieves clarification, or obtains evidence through checks, inspections, reviews, observations, studies, or analysis of one or more review objects.

<li><a href="#">Review objects generally include: mechanisms (e.g. functionality implemented in hardware, software, firmware, application, database); and processes (e.g. system operations, administration, management, exercises).

<li><a href="#">Testing and validation techniques are a form of review method that exercises one or more review objects under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behaviour. The results are used to support the determination of control existence, effectiveness, functionality, correctness, completeness, and potential for improvement over time. 

<li><a href="#">Typical information security auditor actions can include:
<br> • testing access control, identification, authentication and review mechanisms;
<br> • testing security configuration settings;
<br> • conducting penetration testing of key information system components;
<br> • testing information system backup operations; 
<br> • testing incident response capability;
<br> • validating the monitoring and logging;
<br> • testing authorization mechanisms.

<li><a href="#">Blind testing. The information security auditor approaches the review object with no prior knowledge of its characteristics other than publicly available information. The review object is prepared for the review, knowing in advance all the details of the review. A blind review primarily tests the skills of the information security auditor. The breadth and depth of a blind review can only be as vast as the information security auditor's applicable knowledge and efficiency allows. Thus, this testing is of limited use in security reviews and should be avoided.

<li><a href="#">Grey Box Testing. The information security auditor approaches the review object with limited knowledge of its defences and assets but full knowledge of the test vectors available. The review object is prepared for the review, knowing in advance all the details of the review. A grey box review tests the skills of the information security auditor. The nature of the test is efficiency. The breadth and depth depends on the quality of the information provided to the information security auditor before the test as well as the information security auditor's applicable knowledge. Thus, this testing is of limited use in security reviews and should be avoided. This type of test, often referred to as a Vulnerability Test, is most often initiated by the target as a self-assessment activity.

<li><a href="#">Tandem Testing. The information security auditor and the review object are prepared for the review, both knowing in advance all the details of the review. A tandem review tests the protection and controls of the target. However, it cannot test the preparedness of the target to unknown variables. The true nature of the test is thoroughness as the information security auditor has a full view of all the tests and their responses. The breadth and depth depends on the quality of the information provided to the information security auditor before the test, as well as the information security auditor's applicable knowledge. This is often known as an In-House Review and the information security auditor often has an active part in the overall security process.

<li><a href="#">Reversal. The information security auditor approaches the review object with full knowledge of its processes and operational security, but the review object knows nothing of what, how, or when the information security auditor will be testing. The true nature of this test is to review the preparedness of the target to unknown variables and vectors of agitation. The breadth and depth depends on the quality of the information provided to the information security auditor and the information security auditor's applicable knowledge and creativity. This is often called a Red Team exercise. 

<li><a href="#">Representative sampling. Examination that uses a representative sample of review objects (by type and number within type) to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors.

<li><a href="#">Exhaustive sampling. Examination that uses a sufficiently large sample of review objects (by type and number within type) and other specific review objects deemed particularly important to achieving the review objective to provide a level of coverage necessary for determining whether the control is implemented and free of obvious errors and whether there are further increased grounds for confidence that the control is implemented correctly and operating as intended on an ongoing and consistent basis, and that there is support for continuous improvement in the effectiveness of the control.

<li><a href="#">Information security auditors should prepare for the review by:
<br> • understanding the general organization's operations
<br> • understanding the general structure of the information assets (i.e. system architecture);
<br> • thoroughly understanding all the controls being reviewed;
<br> • studying relevant publications that are referenced in those controls;
<br> • establishing appropriate organizational points of contact needed to carry out the review;
<br> • identifying the organizational entities responsible for the development and implementation of the controls under review
<br> • obtaining artefacts needed for the review (e.g. information security controls documentation including organizational charts, policies, procedures, plans, specifications, designs, records, administrator/operator manuals, information system documentation, interconnection agreements, asset inventories);
<br> • obtaining previous review results that can be appropriately reused for the review
<br> • meeting with appropriate organizational officials to ensure common understanding for review objectives
<br> • developing a review plan.

<li><a href="#">Information security auditors developing plans to review controls should determine the type of control review (e.g. complete or partial review), and which controls/control enhancements are to be included in the review based on the purpose/scope of the review.

<li><a href="#">The scope of the assessment needs to be determined by the information security auditor in conjunction with management, using the organization's documentation. This documentation should provide an overview of the security requirements of the information assets and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.

<li><a href="#">The application of a review procedure to a control produces review findings. These review findings are subsequently used to help determine the overall effectiveness of the control. The review objects identify the specific items being reviewed and include specifications, mechanisms, processes, and individuals.

<li><a href="#">Review procedures can be tailored by:
<br> • selecting the review methods and objects needed
<br> • selecting the review method depth and coverage attribute values
<br> • developing information system/platform-specific and organization-specific review procedure adaptations
<br> • eliminating review procedures for controls if they have been reviewed by another adequate review process;
<br> • incorporating review results from previous reviews where the results are deemed applicable.

<li><a href="#">The potential methods and objects in the review procedure are provided as a resource to assist in the selection of appropriate methods and objects, and not with the intent to limit the selection. As such, information security auditors should use their judgment in selecting from the potential review methods and the general list of review objects associated with each selected method.

<li><a href="#">Measure of the quality of the review results is based on the soundness of the rationale provided, not the specific set of methods and objects applied. In most cases, it is not necessary to apply every review method to every review object to obtain the desired review results.

<li><a href="#">The reuse of review results from previously accepted or approved reviews of the information system should be considered in the body of evidence for determining overall control effectiveness. 

<li><a href="#">When considering the reuse of previous review results and the value of those results to the current review, information security auditor should determine: the credibility of the evidence; the appropriateness of previous analysis; and the applicability of the evidence to current information asset conditions.

<li><a href="#">Controls that were deemed effective during previous reviews can have become ineffective due to changing conditions relating to the information asset or the surrounding environment. Thus, it is possible that review results that were found to be previously acceptable, no longer provide credible evidence for determination of control effectiveness, and a new review is required. Applying previous review results to a current review requires the identification of any changes that have occurred since the previous review and the impact of these changes on the previous review results.

<li><a href="#">After selecting the review procedures (including developing necessary procedures not contained in this document), tailoring the procedures for information asset-specific and organization-specific conditions, optimizing the procedures for efficiency, applying the extended review procedure where necessary, and addressing the potential for unexpected events impacting the review, the review plan is finalized and the schedule is established including key milestones for the review process.

<li><a href="#">Each determination statement contained within a review procedure carried out by an information security auditor can have one of the following findings: — Satisfied (S); — Partly satisfied (P); or — Not satisfied (O). 

<li><a href="#">“Satisfied” means that, for the portion of the control addressed by the determination statement, the review information obtained (i.e. evidence collected) indicates that the review objective for the control has been met producing a fully acceptable result. 

<li><a href="#">“Partly satisfied” means that a portion of the control is not addressing its objective or that, at the time of the review, the implementation of the control is still in progress, with reasonable assurance that the control will reach a satisfied result (S). 

<li><a href="#">“Not satisfied” means that, for the portion of the security control addressed by the determination statement, the review information obtained indicates potential anomalies in the operation or implementation of the control that need to be addressed by the organization. If the finding is “not satisfied”, it can also indicate that, for reasons specified in the review report, the information security auditor was not able to obtain sufficient information to make the particular determination requested in the determination statement.

<li><a href="#">The information security auditor should also note the potential for compromises to confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to findings “not satisfied”. If the review reveals major non-conformities (i.e. findings “not satisfied” which deviate significantly from the planned status), which can create a significantly increased risk for the organization, the information security auditor should immediately inform the person responsible for this control and management so that mitigation procedures can be initiated immediately.

<li><a href="#">The output and end result of the review is the review report, which documents the information assurance level based on the implemented information security controls. The report includes information from the information security auditor (in the form of review findings) necessary to determine the effectiveness of the controls employed.

<li><a href="#">Review results should be documented at the level of detail appropriate for the review in accordance with a reporting format prescribed by organizational policy. The reporting format should also be appropriate for the type of control review conducted.

<li><a href="#">At pre-determined milestones or fixed periods after the review, e.g. three months after final reporting, a follow-up review focusing on the outstanding or open issues is performed. This includes verifying the validity of implemented solutions to previous findings. Organizations can also choose to conduct follow-up activities at the next review, especially for the issues that are non-critical or urgent.
